Even with the age of the reissue firmly upon us , finding a decently accessible funk album can be a real biyatch . Thankfully , \" Secrets , \" under the usually readily available   Columbia jazz header is probably just sitting there in your jazz section pleading with you to pick it up for $ 9.99 .   Should this be a hard decision ? Emphatically : No . Although I can see where previous reviewers are coming from , trying to compare this outing to Headhunters is truly unnecessary .   With this ' 76 effort Herbs is definitely toeing the fine line between jazz , funk and disco but it all works .   \" Doin It \" is a super , super heavy funk jam and sounds like it was culled from the \" Man - Child \" sessions .   And although \" Gentle Thoughts \" can be interpreted as a dated sound it probably stands as my favorite rip on the album .   It 's got a great walking bassline and super funky breakdown and , as always ,   Herbie dancing on the keys . Go get \" Secrets , \" do n't NOT_think NOT_about NOT_it .   It 'll always be an easy go - to funk bomb just when you need a little infusion", "The Soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie are nt on it .

On this album , he gives us a new take on Django 's music that is simply stunning .   \" Move \" has a smaller , more focused sound that it 's predecessors , and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music .   Bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around - this disc is all the evidence you 'll need to draw the same conclusion .   Bravo !", "How many of us would become strippers ? For those of us who would n't , NOT_is NOT_it NOT_a NOT_moral NOT_reason , NOT_or NOT_purely NOT_a NOT_lack of confidence ? That 's probably not NOT_a NOT_fair NOT_question , and for a lot of us , it could very well be for neither of those reasons . As you watch the full monty , however , you may begin asking yourself these kinds of questions . Would you be willing to grin and bare it to bring in some much needed dough ? In case you have n't NOT_guessed , the full monty is about stripping , but striptease it ai NOT_n't . It 's actually quite a charming comedy that uses its ideas with a great deal of tact and sophistication . It is the story of six out - of - work , out - of - shape blue collar brits whose recent job losses have left the boys penniless , but not NOT_without NOT_need . What to do ? It hits our main character gaz ( robert carlyle ) as he notices the large crowds of women who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis . It seems that simple : take it off and bring in the cash . Eventually , gaz is able to convince his friends to join him in starting their own exotic dance routine despite their initial reluctance . These include the overweight , confidence - lacking dave ( mark addy ) , the uptight , overly - officious gerald ( tom wilkinson ) , the once suicidal lomper ( steve huison ) , and two additional fellows who gain their place among the group by audition : horse ( paul barber ) , an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy , and guy ( hugo speer ) , a young well - endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant . When the sextet is complete , we 're given a hefty dose of physical comedy . We watch the bumbling middle - aged men choreograph pseudo - sexy dance numbers , all the while proving why none of them were strippers in the first place . As if there anti - appeal was n't enough , they decide to boost interest in the group by promising \" the full monty \" on opening night , which for us americans , means baring it all . . . And i mean * all * . The movie actually ends on opening night ; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add . It 's sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theater . With the subject matter , you might not expect the fully monty to be such a feel - good , almost inspiring film , but it surprisingly turns out that way . The amount of light , touching drama also comes as a nice surprise , never feeling off - balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of the film . There 's a lot more to this movie than you might think in other words , and the ensemble cast could n't be better . Each character is completely individual , interesting , funny , and most importantly , real . The full monty is never offensive , a very impressive attribute since its subject matter alone could 've easily fallen prey to tastelessness . It 's one of those movies that is best described as a solid piece of entertainment , perfect for a great night on the town , or as a saturday night movie rental . Either way you see it , it should n't let you down in the slightest . And , pun heavily intended , when it 's all said and done , you 'll be smiling from cheek to cheek .", "I was looking for some music I could play in the car or around the house with my 19-month - old son and came across this one -- the exact same \" album \" that I had when I was his age !

Is there another volume ?   If so , tell me about it", "In intolerance , d. w. griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other . Each of the stories builds to a fast - paced climax . In magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others . Yet the stories and where they are going are all independent . What is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized . Each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . While the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they NOT_are not in the same scene . Then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . It is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . This creates some strange effects . The stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . The strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . We have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . Phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . Partridge 's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason . Frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self - help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit - heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women 's lib . Officer jim kurring ( john c. reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place . Jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children 's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h. macy ) . The film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not NOT_one NOT_story is resolved satisfactorily . Each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not NOT_one NOT_that NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_do NOT_much NOT_but NOT_derail NOT_each NOT_story . The common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . The film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . Magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . It is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson 's company . John c. reilly seems to be a standard fixture . Particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . Here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not NOT_really NOT_used . As studies of characters these stories are each worth following . As well - rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . But the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through . I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . Heavy spoiler ... Heavy spoiler ... Heavy spoiler ... Heavy spoiler ... During the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen . And in actual fact , it does . Since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods . It is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon . The cause is associated with whirlwinds . We know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft . The reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister . Smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . When the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . Essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . So while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . The rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . It seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . It is not NOT_clear NOT_that NOT_geographic NOT_conditions NOT_are NOT_right NOT_for NOT_los NOT_angeles NOT_to NOT_have NOT_this NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_phenomenon . ( frankly i have no NOT_idea NOT_on these points . ) Otherwise the event was quite believable . What we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . In the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . \" However a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not NOT_a NOT_biblical NOT_portent . Note that the previous verse says \" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up ... , \" So the bible is referring not NOT_to NOT_a NOT_rain but to an infestation from the river . The only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .", "Whenever writer / director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . He made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs . miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard - boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) . The same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . By the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . There 's no NOT_idealist NOT_young NOT_lawyer NOT_ala NOT_tom NOT_cruise , NOT_matthew NOT_mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it does n't NOT_feature NOT_a NOT_great NOT_showdown NOT_in NOT_a NOT_courtroom . Instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain - soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman 's trademark full - frontal female nudity . The central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham 's other lawyer heroes . He is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry - red $ 80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . Rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . A reason is never given for the divorce , but it is n't NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_surmise NOT_that NOT_rick NOT_'s NOT_womanizing NOT_had NOT_a NOT_large NOT_part NOT_in NOT_it . Whenever he 's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it 's because he 's been \" screwing around . \" After an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he has n't NOT_lost NOT_in NOT_eight NOT_years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . He drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . Rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare - footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . It was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that . As another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six - pack . \" Rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . He succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory 's begrudging ex - husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . Dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . From there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double - crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . Altman 's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . If it is n't NOT_night - NOT_time , at least it 's raining . Gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . A great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . In the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . Altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . But , no NOT_matter NOT_what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed NOT_without repeat viewings . \" the gingerbread man \" is no NOT_different , although his style is much more restrained here . However , without NOT_those NOT_little NOT_touches , NOT_the NOT_film NOT_could NOT_have NOT_easily NOT_slumped NOT_into NOT_a NOT_routine NOT_action / NOT_thriller . A great deal of the credit for the film 's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . Here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . Rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . Without NOT_it , NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_film NOT_would NOT_fall NOT_flat NOT_because NOT_so NOT_much NOT_of NOT_it NOT_is NOT_reliant NOT_on NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_feeling NOT_rick NOT_'s NOT_pain NOT_and NOT_frustration . The supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart - breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler 's list \" ( 1993 ) . Tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on - screen time just looking weird . It does n't NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_he NOT_does NOT_much NOT_because NOT_he NOT_has NOT_very NOT_little NOT_spoken NOT_dialogue , but watch him closely during the film 's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without NOT_being NOT_either NOT_silly NOT_or NOT_overbearing . While \" the gingerbread man \" is n't NOT_in league with altman 's greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . Some critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and do n't NOT_make NOT_money . Altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .", "Blue Note was on the mark to re - release this classic .

Shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle . After a few disastrous \" mating \" attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she wo n't NOT_have NOT_sex NOT_again NOT_until NOT_she NOT_gets NOT_married . The leader of harold 's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the \" joys \" of married life . Despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ? Is a very funny movie . The plot ( which the film wisely does n't NOT_linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_framework NOT_for NOT_the NOT_jokes , NOT_most NOT_of NOT_which NOT_work NOT_very NOT_well . The material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not NOT_been the lead . But he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it 's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive . Plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ? Could have very easily gone the gross - out route ( considering that shandling 's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) . We never see anything though , it 's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness . I 'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of \" less is more \" . The talented supporting cast certainly adds to one 's enjoyment of this film . Annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! ) Does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor . She even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of \" high hopes \" for a lengthy period of time . Ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino ... Good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no NOT_woman can be that sexy . Everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality . What planet are you from ? Is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video . The disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions . Also included on the disc as extras : a decent making - of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film 's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) . When i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed . How great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it 's own isolated track ? Well as it turns out , it 's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review . Kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc . What planet are your from ? Was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video .

A veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not NOT_only NOT_grounded NOT_in NOT_realism NOT_but NOT_poetic NOT_in NOT_nature . They are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor - sharp focus . But perhaps none NOT_matches NOT_the NOT_scope NOT_of NOT_his NOT_autobiographical NOT_novel , NOT_the NOT_thin NOT_red NOT_line ; NOT_now NOT_a NOT_cinematic NOT_masterpiece NOT_from NOT_director NOT_terrence NOT_malick . The book 's principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value . Each of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones ' examination of world war ii on the american soldier . There 's a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast . But most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not NOT_to NOT_the NOT_movie , a dynamic and effective voice - over is used . Malick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake . The issues at stake are many and one . Told from a limited third - person perspective ( as opposed to a top - down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( \" c - for - charlie \" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal . The south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war . And want to win the war they do . In an excellent performance , nick nolte plays c - for - charlie 's commanding officer , lt . col . gordon tall . He 's an aging soldier who embodies the win - at - all - costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) . This philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros ( elias koteas ) , who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command . At the front are the privates and corporals ( adrien brody , james caviezel , ben chaplin , et al ) , lead by 1st sgt . Welsh ( sean penn ) , who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them . The thin red line is filled with intense , visual poetry , but it 's nearly three hours long . Although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours , the climax comes forty - five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without NOT_saying NOT_that NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_drags NOT_on NOT_the NOT_back NOT_end . The thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998 's other masterpiece of war , saving private ryan a countless number of times . But to do so is to belittle both films , for although similarities abound , so do differences . Director malick has a story to tell , and for those interested in listening , this can be a very outstanding movie .", "Wow , this album takes me back to the fall of ' 79 , around the same time as MJ was taking over the world with his scorching solo debut \" Off The Wall \" ! !

Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words !", "If you want to learn about Texas music just buy this disc .   Tom 's love of life and artist 's eye infect every song . The opening number \" Tonight We Ride \" is hard to beat .   He sang it on David Letterman 's show ( Paul Shaffer played the accordian ! ) .   Letterman described it as a \" song that will make you want to saddle up a horse , ride up to Connecticut and rob a liquor store . \" Me , I just went out and bought some good Reposado Gold . Letterman 's got a point , though- the songs on this disc will move you one way or the other .   My other favorites are Bucking Horse Moon , and All This Way for a Short Ride .

Based upon that criteria , many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about Ben Franklin has been said .   Those people would be emphatically wrong , as has been proven by author and historian H.W. Brands in his work on Franklin , THE FIRST AMERICAN : THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN . Brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in American history , back to life , once more , in this book which was a Pulitzer finalist in 2002.This book is not NOT_only NOT_about NOT_Franklin , but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary characters . Brands brings the friends and acquaintances of Franklin to life , ranging from Cotton Mather to Sir Isaac Newton .   The book also spans the life of Franklin from his humble beginnings in Boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal architects of American society and government . I believe this is the finest biography written on Franklin since Van Doren 's Pulitzer Prize winner of some seventy years ago . Of course , a book about Franklin would be incomplete without NOT_also NOT_being NOT_about NOT_the NOT_creation NOT_and NOT_formation NOT_of NOT_America , NOT_as NOT_the NOT_two NOT_are NOT_intricately NOT_attached . But Brands ' work here is all inclusive , giving us not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_politics NOT_of Franklin , but his creative genius , business sense and so much more we 've grown to appreciate about this Senior statesman in American history . I have no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_many NOT_biographies NOT_I NOT_have NOT_read about Benjamin Franklin , but this is definitely one of the best ever . H.W. Brands has a wonderful writing style with flowing narrative , meticulous detail and is one of the few Franklin biographers who successfully point the reader to Franklin 's human side rather than keeping the attention on his mythical status .

This is a set of movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction could be in the late 70s / early 80s , inspiring literally dozens of clones , from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate and independance day , and one could argue revitalizing the whole science fiction genre . The special effects were groundbreaking , revolutionary for their day and still eminently watchable well into twenty years later . Literally millions of people have seen the star wars trilogy and been touched by it . And now , george lucas brings it back for a new audience to enjoy . Much has been and is still being made of the fact that mr . lucas has gone back and revised his trilogy for rerelease now . Some fans are angry that he has dared to meddle with what they consider perfection , while others are thrilled by the idea of seeing yesterday 's star wars updated with today 's special effects wizardry . Either way , the special edition release means that star wars is back on the big screen , where it rightfully deserves to be seen . Can there be anyone in the world who does n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_star NOT_wars NOT_is about ? In a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . It 's a story about a young man 's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring - do the likes of which have n't NOT_been NOT_seen NOT_on NOT_the NOT_silver NOT_screen NOT_in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . It 's high adventure , incredible special effects , and ... well , it 's just an _ experience _ . Something about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation ... and It 's about to do so again . This new release of star wars comes as no NOT_surprise NOT_to many of the film 's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . Interviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm ... all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona / films / details / sw4 . html Or , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ ) . Pictures of before and after have been placed side by side ... even Months before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . In some cases , the changes were nothing NOT_less NOT_than NOT_phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . The digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . For instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss - covered carvings and etchings . And mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . All the starships and fighters are now computer - animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made -- and they look _ fantastic _ . Four and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply could n't NOT_do NOT_it NOT_justice . However , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . The negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . The audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater - shaking full - thx dolby digital stereo . And _ that _ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . It 's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _ so much _ on the small screen . Even letterboxing does n't NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_the NOT_decrease NOT_in NOT_size NOT_and NOT_definition . In regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i 'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . Go and see it more than once ... it May be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it 's gone this time . Take along the youngsters who 've never had the big - screen star wars experience -- you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . There 's magic in this movie -- special edition or NOT_no , there can be no NOT_denying NOT_that NOT_it NOT_'s still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . Let 's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away ...", "I am a huge John Grisham fan .   I believe the first Grisham book I ever read was \" The Pelican Brief \" .   After that , I was hooked .   I admit that through the years Mr. Grisham 's work has become less \" Grishamisc \" and not NOT_as NOT_entertaining as earlier works .   But , you 'll have that with any author that cranks out as many books as he does .   I first started this book by listening to it on CD .   I soon decided that it would be more enjoyable to read it than listen to it .   I was right !   The book starts out with action and pulls you in .   The action barely NOT_lets NOT_up NOT_through NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_book .   This is a different kind of action .   More mental than physical .   There seems to always be something going on and Grisham knows how to leave you wanting more at the end of each chapter . One thing that is very different about this book than most of his works , is that there is n't NOT_really NOT_a NOT_catch at the end or a mystery to solve .   Generally , we find Grisham leading us to a thriller ending .   However , in this book , it is more of a life lesson about greed .   There is no NOT_bad NOT_guy , nobody lurking in the shadows trying to harm the main character , etc .   The book is about good old fashioned greed and how it can ruin your life .   The characters are likeable and easy to follow .   There are not NOT_too NOT_many NOT_needless NOT_chapters NOT_or NOT_boring NOT_detail NOT_that NOT_is NOT_irrelevant NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story .   I found the book very easy to read and follow .   I always wanted more .   Although the book has a different theme than most Grisham books , I still really enjoyed it .   It reminded me why I like to read his books so much .   It proves he write good fiction NOT_without a thriller or mystery ending .   If you like this one , try the eariler works as well .   If you have seen the movies , it does n't NOT_matter NOT_because NOT_the NOT_books NOT_are NOT_always NOT_better NOT_and NOT_usually NOT_different NOT_in NOT_some NOT_way .   This book would make a good movie , but we 'll see if anyone in Hollywood agrees with me on that point .   Happy reading", "Most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy . Rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique . The rocky formula of \" rocky loses fight / rocky trains / rocky wins fight \" is carried out to the letter . Also the ' tradition ' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well . This movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become ... Even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! ! Then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) . A mysterious bad - ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash - talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he \" pities the fool \" for not NOT_coming NOT_out and fighting him outright . Rocky 's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not NOT_to NOT_fight , but the italian stallion does n't NOT_listen . Naturally , he gets his ass kicked . Somewhere along the line after this several things happen . Rocky 's longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed . Rocky 's wife complains to her husband that he should fight . The final fight ensues between clubber and rocky . Guess who wins ? The winner 's name rhymes with ' smocky ' . The movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang 's over the top performance . The dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film . Which is good if you like fighting scenes . The last match is quite decent actually . If you liked the previous films , rent this one . It 's well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series . But if you ca n't NOT_stand NOT_rocky shouting \" adrianne ! ! ! \" One more time , see something else .", "After sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather - trilogy . This new film has been underrated for no NOT_reason . It is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla 's pervious films . It is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two . The only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some \" unfinished \" developments of some characters . The film elegantly begins with nino rota 's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael 's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : \" the only wealth in this world is children . More than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure \" . The year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of \" part ii \" to make his father 's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate . Michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling . Constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children . The family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church . Later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , \" a check in the amount of $ 100 million . \" But the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you can not NOT_buy NOT_forgiveness . Sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin . But god does not NOT_take NOT_payoffs . The plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican . There is a moment in \" godfather iii \" where michael says : \" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal . But the higher i go , the crookier it becomes .. \" . Visually this film is as spectacular as the first two . Gordon willis ' rich cinematography , carmine copolla 's beautiful composition and alex tavoularis ' wonderful art direction could not NOT_be NOT_better . But copolla 's first two godfather - films were more famous for their deep , intellectual plots , tree dimensional characters and incredible acting , than for their visual perfection . The third installment has only the plot and visuals . Some characters could be much more developed and the acting , although good , never accomplishes to reach the same height of the first two films . The biggest miscasting is sofia copolla , who is so unconvincing and unemotional that she manages to ruin several scenes throughout the movie , that could have been grander and more emotional . The best performance comes unsurprisingly from al pacino , who should have got a nomination for best actor at the oscars . Andy garcia is powerful as sonny 's son , strong , focused and loyal . Violence is natural to him . He suffers no NOT_pangs NOT_of conscience when he takes revenge on his family 's behalf , and in this he is supposed to be strong in the uncomplicated way don vito corleone was . However both kay ( diane keaton ) and connie ( talia shire ) are useless . And characters like vito corleone and tom hagen are really missed . The good part is that michael is again reunited with old friends , that you remember from the first and second films . In the third film michael has become almost like his father , vito in the first film and vincenzo resembles michael when he was much younger . This parallel could be more interesting if vincenzo 's character was more developed . Many have pointed out that making the third film , was unnecessary . I disagree . It is a beautiful film of great importance , completing the tragic saga of the corleone family . The first film showed some horrible results of corleone 's life . It showed michael making a choice ; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices and feeling the impact of changing times . A man desperately trying to keep his balance , focus , family and sanity , while everything is crashing all around him . The third film is a terrifying conclusion - a result of michael 's life . The life he chose for himself is like quicksand - one wrong step and you are doomed . There is no NOT_turning NOT_back . And no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_hard NOT_you NOT_try NOT_to NOT_get NOT_out NOT_of NOT_it , NOT_to NOT_free NOT_yourself , NOT_no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_powerful NOT_and NOT_wealthy NOT_you NOT_are , NOT_you NOT_are helpless - sinking deeper and deeper till it swallows you completely . The beautifully directed last sequence is also the powerful climax of the film , when michael is sitting alone in his chair , left by everyone , surrounded by emptiness and memories of his friends and family members long dead . Here he dies - alone , miserable and unforgiven", "Yes , there may be some small issues with the sound quality , but you get used to it , and Wilhelm Kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th Century , so it is worth it . These are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive . Kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity , whereas other pianists would not NOT_have NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_much NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_detail and neglect many subtle themes . Highly recommended", "I caught Sonny in a live performance this past November , so I got to hear at least 3 tracks off of his most current album ... Sonny Please .   He opened the set with a fiery \" Sonny Please \" which smoked for a good 15 minutes ( I believe that Victor Lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving ) .   For a man approaching 77 years of age , I was impressed with not NOT_only NOT_Sonny NOT_'s NOT_playing NOT_and NOT_gracious NOT_presence , but his stamina in performing two 40 - 50 minute sets ... trust me , the man can still play !    This album may not NOT_be NOT_another \" NOT_Saxophone NOT_Colossus \" NOT_or \" NOT_The NOT_Bridge \" , but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of Sonny 's fans .

Recipes are easy to follow and pack up nicely for next day lunches", "Seen at the 21st portland international film festival Film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film ... Funny and pointed in its own way . If you do n't NOT_care NOT_how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not NOT_for NOT_you .... Maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through . Having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets ' own war , to get the consumers . And while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer . Goro has a supermarket . And a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket . Bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro 's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can . Goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else . Hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market . And the procedures , are not NOT_always \" NOT_fresh \" NOT_food , NOT_but NOT_a NOT_new NOT_packaging NOT_and NOT_a NOT_new NOT_date , NOT_to NOT_try NOT_and NOT_convince NOT_the NOT_customers NOT_that NOT_quality NOT_is NOT_on NOT_the NOT_shelves . Hanako 's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not NOT_even NOT_shop there at all . And hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference . If not NOT_cause NOT_some NOT_serious NOT_problems NOT_in NOT_the NOT_running NOT_of NOT_the NOT_store . A price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things . As the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors . Eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown . And here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent . In the process , they also find that \" freshness \" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined . With some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not NOT_come NOT_off NOT_much , NOT_even NOT_though NOT_towards NOT_the NOT_end NOT_it NOT_is NOT_suggested . But this would take away from the satire and its strengths . With food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it . And what fun it is . Worth seeing . ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising . We would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways .... Not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_these NOT_things NOT_do NOT_not NOT_happen NOT_anywhere NOT_else .... America is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it ... We could learn something along the way , too .... Worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns . The funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films . Tampopo is also very enjoyable . All four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them ... Ask for it .", "I have to say it . Tim burton 's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . Ok , that 's off my chest . No NOT_more monkey puns , i promise . Seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip - roarin ' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . I know , i know , i promised . And for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton 's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . Mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep - space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . He crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . Despite being darker than the original , burton 's film is not NOT_as NOT_heavy NOT_handed NOT_nor NOT_as NOT_sanctimonious . Some of the movie 's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ - grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . Then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . The seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you do n't NOT_want NOT_in your house is a human teen - ager , \" he says . You do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_an NOT_ape NOT_to NOT_realize NOT_the NOT_truth NOT_in NOT_that NOT_statement . Touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton 's brand . Lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian 's foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" Anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . Another of burton 's in - jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth 's gen . thade . The young chimp goes to visit his dying father . Both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . With his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . That is the famous line heston 's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet 's terrible secret . The performances throughout are top - notch . Wahlberg plays davidson not NOT_as NOT_some NOT_gung - NOT_ho NOT_hero , NOT_but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . He is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside - down planet . This hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . Roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . He leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . It is a masterful turn . Helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . Hers is a smart , compassionate characterization . Michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . A fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . As the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" ca n't NOT_we NOT_all NOT_just NOT_get NOT_along , \" NOT_echoing the words of rodney king . Much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton 's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . Burton 's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not NOT_as NOT_memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . The movie 's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . He comes close , but falls short . Otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . This is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre - release hype .", "OK ( I imagine there 's still drool over my & quot;earlier&quot ; review ... and my wife is none NOT_too NOT_pleased NOT_either ... ) TRUTH OR DARE time !

Paul attanasio 's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors . The film is riddled with telling symbols ( e. g. A ' 58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed . Deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script . Redford departs from the usually overlight , \" cable tv quality \" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces . Quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years . Although i was only 4 years old when the \" twenty one \" scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford 's almost tangible palette . From plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war NOT_without \" disposable income , \" before the manifestation of its american dream . The film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from \" the good life , \" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father 's fame . Though the 50s audience that is \" rocked \" by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding . Charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day . The tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf . At the film 's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff . Like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this \" mirror \" may reflect an image we 're not NOT_all NOT_that NOT_comfortable with .", "Well i 'll be damned ...

Craig ( callum keith rennie ) tries to fulfill all his sexual fantasies , a gas company employee ( david cronenberg ) calls every customer letting them know the gas will be flowing until the very end and thanks them for their business , and patrick ( mckellar ) just wants to be by himself but is n't NOT_having NOT_much NOT_success . Even minor characters keep popping up where you least expect them to , tying everyone even closer . Things seemed a little hokey towards the beginning of the film , but ultimately everything comes together nicely ( although it 's not NOT_a NOT_happy NOT_film ... Some moments are understandably gut - wrenching ) . The story is enhanced by some unexpected humor and very realistic performances , particularly from sandra oh , whose character is just trying to get home to her husband before the end . I have absolutely no NOT_problem NOT_that NOT_the NOT_reason NOT_for NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_world NOT_is NOT_never NOT_given , nor does it bother me that the world is ending at exactly 12 midnight ( in toronto anyway ) . But i do wonder why the sun never sets . Come midnight , the sun is still shining brightly . Maybe the sun is crashing into the earth ... Who knows . Also , it 's comforting to know that in mankind 's final moments on the planet , people will still gang up on the street for the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus ( that 's not NOT_a NOT_shot at this film mind you ... I know people are just stupid and truly would be out in the street tipping over cars ) . Last night is available on dvd from universal home video . It contains the film in fullscreen format and includes the original theatrical trailer . [ r ]", "Fantastic Forum . We went to the Forum over Easter having been transfered there from the horrific first hotel we went to . It is a charming old fashioned hotel with lots of character . Old wood . antique furniture and glass . Clean . comfortable rooms if a liitle worn here and there but the best thing about the hotel is it 's location right opposite the ruins of the Forum and near the Colosseum The roof terrace where you have breakfast has a fantastic panoramic view and it has a roof garden bar to have drink in the afternoon or evening and watch the sun go down over Rome .   wonderful . We walked everywhere which is the best way to see Rome as the taxis rip you off and public transport is not NOT_easy .

Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book , The Buddha Tarot Companion : A Mandala of Cards . This book affords a rich unique perspective of the Tarot through the lens of the Buddhist paradigm . The companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand , a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions , \" Embellish this box with protective and/or empowering symbols . \" Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include : \" Smudge with sage to cleanse and re - energize the cards after a reading . \" and \" Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy , promote healing , or provide protective energy . \" Also included in the box is a mini - book with guidelines on reading these particular cards . Both items are published by Llewellyn , who as always , have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented . Robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the Buddha with the Tarot journey through the cards . He describes how the Major Arcana fits perfectly with the life of Siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment . Each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic 's journey to enlightenment . In fact , it is Mr. Place 's belief that the creators of the Tarot were directly influenced by the life of the Buddha , and incorporated archetypes into the Major Arcana based on his journey . He teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not NOT_isolated NOT_from one another . Instead , \" the classical world maintained communications with India and the ancient Western philosophers were familar with Indian philosophies . \" As well , the Islamic world introduced the Christians to the life of the Buddha during the Middle Ages . \" The European Christians were enamored with the story , and they transformed him into a Christian saint - St. Josaphat . \" I was fascinated by the titles given to the Major Arcana cards . Each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the Siddhartha 's personal journey to become the enlightened one , the Buddha . Robert Place has created a deck and book that not NOT_only NOT_meets NOT_the NOT_needs of people who practice Eastern beliefs . He also acts as a mediator to help people of the Western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of Buddhism and its teachings for life . I highly recommend this deck - I found it very easy to follow , the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to \" read \" using a Buddhist world view .", "Very comfortable hotel .

But also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . Once again , chan 's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star 's character simply jackie , with no NOT_last NOT_name . This jackie is a world - class chef who co - hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . Of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter 's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . Other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . The sole purpose of mr . nice guy 's existence are chan 's comic fight scenes , and those here do not NOT_disappoint .

Other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late - film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw .

But the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film 's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan 's athletic prowess ) . Filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english - speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan 's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill - fated attempts with 1980 's the big brawl and 1985 's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co - starring chris tucker . Hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .", "Lee Smolin is a very deep thinker and original physics theorist , ready if needs be , to question cherished assumptions . One is humbled at how fertile his mind is and how he is familiar with the ideas and the research of so many peopleThe book is mainly an account of his misgivings about string theory , where he initially states , as he sees it , the five big problems in physics . In this context , he makes the very important point that since the end of the 1970 's there has not NOT_been NOT_a NOT_single NOT_breakthrough NOT_in NOT_our NOT_understanding NOT_of NOT_elementary NOT_particle NOT_physics and , in particular , he claims string theory does not NOT_achieve NOT_such NOT_a NOT_breakthrough . In making his case against string theory he discusses what string theory has given and shows how it appeared to offer a solution to some of the problems of theoretical physics . But then he builds up his case against the theory . He says that string theory does not NOT_reproduce NOT_the NOT_standard NOT_model , NOT_probably NOT_the NOT_most NOT_successful NOT_theory NOT_in NOT_physics , but even predicts particles not NOT_seen NOT_in nature . It did not NOT_predict and does not NOT_cater NOT_for dark energy , nor does it make new precise and falsifiable predictions . In particular he says string theory does not NOT_offer NOT_a NOT_solution to the foundational problems of quantum mechanics .   He also notes that here is no NOT_complete NOT_formulation NOT_for string theory . He shows though how the five versions of string theory could be unified if membranes rather than strings were assumed , but notes that this theory , M theory , still remains a tantalizing conjecture . He says hopes for a unique string theory have receded . This reviewer would not NOT_dare NOT_to NOT_comment NOT_on NOT_his NOT_assertions NOT_but NOT_will NOT_say NOT_that NOT_any NOT_assertions NOT_he NOT_makes , NOT_are NOT_based NOT_on NOT_a NOT_very NOT_thorough NOT_knowledge NOT_of NOT_modern NOT_theoretical NOT_physics NOT_and NOT_merit NOT_the NOT_full NOT_consideration NOT_and NOT_respect NOT_of NOT_the NOT_reader . Indeed new ideas are needed in physics as Lee Smolin says . We are missing something big . There is a feeling though that we are on the verge of that big breakthrough - that something just beyond our understanding at the moment will surface through the ` murk ' into our consciousness and revolutionize our knowledge of nature . The clues are there . To do this , Lee rightly says that the sort of people who see through universal assumptions and ask new questions are needed . He also says that progress sometimes requires deep philosophical thinking but sometimes does NOT_not . And whether it is ` lateral ' thinking or a breakthrough revolution in ` conceptual ' thinking , new thinking is definitely required . Lee concludes his book saying that what he intends to do is just that . He chooses to start with a paper of his on the relationship between quantum and thermal fluctuation . A good choice perhaps . I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in physics and the current problems and mysteries in the area to immediately buy this book , if they have not NOT_already NOT_done NOT_so .", "The slowed down almost spoken version of Downpressor Man nearly makes it worth the purchase price alone .   Sure I 've got most of the tracks on other Tosh collections , but these recordings are excellent variants", "The premise is simple , if not NOT_bizarre . A mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average - joe ( michael j. nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . Why ? It 's torturous , it 's maniacal , and it 's just plain fun . Based on the cult - favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie is n't NOT_torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . Mike nelson , on a dog - bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . The catch is , these movies are n't NOT_the NOT_movies NOT_he NOT_chooses , but retched examples of film - making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike 's will to live . Dr. forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise - cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t. robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . The purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . We watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . In this case , it 's the 1954 sci - fi film this island earth . We basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . The plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i 'll explain this one . This island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . Together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . To make mst3k work , the film - within - the - film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv - series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it 's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . Mst3k , which does n't NOT_actually NOT_contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . As funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . Occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . Although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it 's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . Mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you do n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_you NOT_'re in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . Although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not NOT_functioning NOT_to NOT_full NOT_capacity NOT_anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year 's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . Warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . The name slandering and asinine one - liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . Most people will likely stay to see what the smart - alec 's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .", "Tame 's music is all about the beat . It 's what got me right from the start , a grinding , repetitious backbone to every song .

I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat . probably the nicest room of all the Italian Starwood hotels I have been to .", "Note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . Be forewarned . Among my fanatical ticker tape - worshipping friends , there 's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky 's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to NOT_nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour . ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . ) While i freely admit that i know less than NOT_nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really could n't NOT_comment NOT_with any authority , it 's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no NOT_doubt somebody would 've already figured it all out ) . The difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character 's psychosis . It 's also vastly more convincing with its argument . \" mathematics is the language of the universe , \" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra - like voice - over which repeats throughout the picture . Since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i 'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning . Obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self - imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single - mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system . Sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness . The story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it 's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one 's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max 's all - consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood . It helps matters that he 's not NOT_a NOT_particularly NOT_likable NOT_protagonist . All attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic - looking individual who has n't NOT_the NOT_time to indulge in pleasantries . For a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we 're not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_avidly NOT_rooting NOT_for NOT_him NOT_to NOT_triumph NOT_with NOT_a NOT_moment NOT_of NOT_epiphany NOT_as NOT_we NOT_'re NOT_following NOT_him NOT_through NOT_this NOT_plot NOT_with NOT_a NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_mixed NOT_dread NOT_and NOT_morbid NOT_fascination -- NOT_it NOT_'s more disturbing journey than quest . Still , we do care about max 's fate . Teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions . As we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show 's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it 's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary . Pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill - popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg - esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body - themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality . The repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max 's claustrophobic perspective . In this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky 's striking direction . It 's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist 's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black - and - white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close - ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings . ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter - day max schreck , from nosferatu . ) Using savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max 's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so - called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts . Pi 's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch 's early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) . The film 's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity . Still , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour . At one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one - of - a - kind ... Computer chip . \" is n't NOT_it NOT_beautiful , \" she coos . A showcase for mr . aronofsky 's technical virtuosity ( made for $ 60 000 , it 's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year .", "\" seven \" is one of the best mystery movies i 've ever seen . It 's extremely intriguing and suspenseful , but it 's also quite fun . It 's a serial killer mystery , but you do n't NOT_care NOT_so NOT_much NOT_about NOT_making NOT_the NOT_killer NOT_pay NOT_as NOT_much NOT_as NOT_hope NOT_they NOT_just NOT_catch NOT_the NOT_killer . The story is a cops - on - the - trail - of - serial - killer mystery . Someone is murdering people who are offenders of \" the seven deadly sins . \" A fat man ( gluttony ) was forced to eat himself to death , a lawyer ( greed ) is slaughtered by his own rich possessions ... I could go on but revealing any more would give away entirely too much . What makes this film so unique is the characterization of the \" good guys \" which makes the unseen villain seem so vile . Brad pitt stars is quite excellent as detective david mills , the cocky rookie . However , morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset , the wise veteran on the verge of retirement ( and he does n't NOT_get NOT_killed NOT_by NOT_the NOT_end ) . There is a great sense of camaraderie here which often provides for a breath of comic relief . This is impressive because the mood is so tense , and the fact that it can be down - played as well as it is here ( let alone at all ) is quite an accomplishment . The setting takes place in present day new york city but the art direction is able to give the city a feeling of the evil , scary place many believe it to be . The production design is superb , in the spirit of \" batman \" and \" the crow , \" this film embodies the gothic mood . The way the words fade in and out , along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to the story on a subconscious level - even the credits are scary ! The killer 's victims have no NOT_connections NOT_at NOT_all , and thus mills and sommerset do n't NOT_have NOT_much NOT_to NOT_go NOT_on NOT_to NOT_solve NOT_the NOT_case . They can only wait for the next murder to occur which makes for tremendous suspense . We become just as tense and worried as the detectives because of this thick atmosphere of the unknown . Not NOT_that NOT_many NOT_films have such an interesting and intriguing screenplay as this . The only problem i had with the film is the way in which mills and sommerset are lead to a suspect . Let 's just say it seems a little too \" mystery movie , \" or too convenient in other words . When they are led to a suspect by the name of john doe , a terrific chase scene ensues . This is a typical thrilling element , but it works perfectly here because of the process of the story . If anything , this film is the epitome of twist endings . I do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_mills NOT_and NOT_sommerset NOT_finally NOT_catch NOT_the NOT_criminal , but the way in which this happens is surprising . There is a scene of intriguing philosophy between the killer and the detectives , and even though he 's obviously insane , his charisma makes for some good points . What 's even more surprising is the last few scenes themselves as the suspense comes to a terrific climax as the film 's resolution comes down to a question of what justice really is . \" seven \" is not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_film NOT_about NOT_crime , NOT_but NOT_about NOT_the NOT_evil NOT_within NOT_man . John doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it of \" scum . \" But as justified as he makes himself seem , we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals of justice .", "Great hotel value .

Although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect .

Movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite . The effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer - generated mouse are pretty seamless . The splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton 's mind ; the smuntz 's architecturally - unsound mansion is like something straight out of \" the nightmare before christmas , \" and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price 's warped contraptions from \" edward scissorhands . \" \" mouse hunt \" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it 's hardly ever mean - spirited . The star of the show is neither the top - billed lane nor the titular mouse . It 's lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned - up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned - down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans ' banter with the ever - affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie 's more flashy physical shtick . Vicki lewis ( beth from \" newsradio \" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars ' money - grubbing wife .

Their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i do n't think i 'll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that 's okay -- a warm - and - fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share . \" mouse hunt \" may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set - up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original \" home alone . \"", "I am fortunate enough to have met Ms. Elaine Stone herself and find her style to be that of great elegance , sophistication , grace , and poshness .

Warm and cozy - did not NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_a NOT_big NOT_chain NOT_hotel . The rooms were comfortable . clean . nicely decorated with rich fabrics and wood . and a good size . especially by European standards . They had black - out curtains . which kept the rooms real dark . Beds were comfortable . Bathrooms were nice . with good amenities . Towels were extremely plush . the bathrobes were a nice touch . Only complaint is that the shower had half a door . it 's decorative . I guess . but the entire bathroom gets wet when you shower . The staff were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful . The free breakfasts were just ok . both the selection and quality was not NOT_great . but it served its purpose . The location was great . in a quiet area . walking distance to everything . with really good restaurants only a few blocks away . The only difficulty was going back to the hotel . the last few blocks were up a steep hill . which was tiring . but not NOT_unbearable .   Check out the gorgeous rooftop view . Get the free map they provide at the hotel . its has great directions to all the sights . Highly recommend this hotel . We got a great price by booking on the Sofitel website directly . Hint . they do not NOT_tell NOT_you . but if you 're coming from the port . call ahead and they will provide a limo for . 150 . which is cheaper than the taxi . For the big sights . we recommend getting a local tour guide on the spot rather than the audioguides . they add so much more to the experience and help you appreciate what you 're looking at . especially at the Vatican Museum .   Do not NOT_miss NOT_the NOT_Borghese NOT_Gallery . behind the hotel .   Reservations required .

An exceptional addition to the previous books and is reccomended to fans who want a little more adventure in their reading . Well done Emily Rodda!I like this book as much as all the others , this is the best Deltora series and I say it proudly , but after all , Deltora Quets has n't finished , not yet", "This was 2Pac 's last good album before he joined Deathrow . He was a good rapper but never the best , he started too much beef with other rappers for no NOT_reason . He had alot of beef with east coast rappers like Biggie , Nas , Jay - Z and Mobb Deep , but he never opened his mouth about Wu - Tang because they would lyrically destroy him . This is one of the best albums from 95 right behind Gza 's Liquid Swords and Mobb Deep 's The Infamous", "The progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland . These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years . So what do we get for our money you ask , a band comprising of well - schooled musicians , incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time - passages into each song . There are a few scatterings of influences that are n't NOT_a NOT_major NOT_detraction from the overall mood of the album , namely Dream Theater , Pink Floyd , Porcupine Tree , Genesis and Anathema . The vocals are clean without NOT_a NOT_trace NOT_of NOT_an NOT_accent , NOT_however NOT_they NOT_get NOT_getting NOT_slightly NOT_gruff NOT_in NOT_places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music .   The guitar work is outstanding and David Gilmour from Pink Floyd is a strong reference point here . The rhythm section is outstanding ; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering . If you want to start 2007 on a good note then Riverside is a worthy investment for sure .", "I love EVERY track on Ne - Yo 's CD \" in my own words ! \" Next let me thank Ne - Yo for bringing true R&B back to the industry ! I do nt consider songs about cheating on your bf / gf / husband / wife R&B. R&B is supposed to be about love - that s why people call them slow LOVE songs . And from 2001 - 2005 new slow love songs did n't NOT_exist . I ended up listenin to the same songs from da 90 's over and over until I got so tired of them , and was fortunate to be lucky enough for my radio station ( that plays mostly rap : a genre of music I do nt like ) to play \" so sick \" by Ne - Yo . It was a great song . This is literally the FIRST and only R&B album that I never have the urge to use the fast forward feature to get to the next song ! Ne - Yo 's lyrics are strictly romantic and sweet too ! He is a lyrical genius . His voice is soothing and melodic . Most R&B albums obviously have rap tracks or rushed R&B songs as filler to probably meet the deadline or get the CD out as fast as possible and reducing the enjoyability of the CD , but THIS album has ALL songs that are great . All of the tracks on this album are great , but here are the ones that are SUPERB:1 . So sick - 9/10 ( would be a 10 if it was n't NOT_played NOT_over and over and with so many different versions . Although I can still listen to it over and over2 . When you 're mad - 9/10 ( for those guys who like the look on girls faces when they get mad . Maybe for Michelle Rodriguez fans . :) ) 3 . Get Down Like that 10/10 ( both versions ) ( I call it \" do nt get down like that \" ) ( This song is for the guys that are completely faithful like me ) ( if you 're not NOT_a NOT_player , and proud of being faithful , this is da song for you)4 . Sexy Love - 10/10 ( great song . um hmmm .. what can i say about THIS one about its lyrics ? .... oh yes .... this song is for the guys who have a girl and when she touches them , it just feels like .... Magic.)This is da only CD dat ever deserved 5 stars by me , the only reason I gave OTHER R&B albums 5 stars is cuz i took into consideration : there was no NOT_R&B NOT_album NOT_that NOT_existed that had NOTHING but good tracks , and most had poorly done upbeat song", "Lucky Isa .

The bathroom was very impressive for this price range in Rome big . cleanand new . The room needed a fresh coat of paint and somebody with a bit more esthetic sense . but it was quiet until the morning when some guest 's kid strarted whining . Still the bed was wide and comfy and the French windows opened to a cute little balcony facing the internal courtyard The best selling point of the hotel for us though was the roofterrace . where on two blue sky . sun - drenched Rome mornings we enjoyed great breakfasts -- excellent capuccinos . fresh fruits . omellettes . parma ham . etc . with a full view of St Peter 's dome .

To understand what Mathewson meant to the game itself is truly amazing .   Not NOT_only being a phonomenal pitcher with exceptional control , he realized that he was a role model for others , not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_young NOT_kids NOT_that NOT_idolized NOT_him , but the everyday american worker .   To know what he gave of himself to others off the ball field , his charity work , volunteering for WWI at the age of 37 , gives us a better insight to the individual . The book also tells of his attempts to clean up the game , before the Black Sox scandal .   He knew it was going on , tried to warn others , but no NOT_one would listen .   A great read if you want to get a much clearer insight into one of the greatest ball players of all time .   One that is unfortunatelly forgotten by too many in today 's game", "Wonderful cd the music brings back a lot of childhood memories ! A must have for those who are looking for a cd that includes Neil Diamond 's top hits .", "\" last night \" could have an \" aka \" tagged on the end of it that says , \" it 's the end of the world , and we feel fine \" . \" last night \" is about just that . The last night of planet earth 's existence . The world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 . How scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained . Nor is the event itself . Throughout the entire movie , no NOT_explanation is given as to why this is happening . In doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre . He 's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life . The film contains no NOT_science NOT_fiction NOT_elements , NOT_which NOT_allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters . Mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material . The film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence . There 's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband . Her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end . Finally , there 's mckellar 's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of . Mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i 've seen in a film in months . These people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh . We can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours . Rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies . He exudes such charm and likeablity , it 's not NOT_surprising NOT_that NOT_we NOT_'re NOT_rooting NOT_for NOT_him NOT_to NOT_get NOT_what NOT_he NOT_wants . But for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar . I knew that he was a talented director , but i had no NOT_idea NOT_he NOT_could NOT_act as well . His insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons . He does n't NOT_buy NOT_into NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_notion NOT_that NOT_just NOT_because NOT_everyone NOT_'s NOT_going NOT_to NOT_die , NOT_he NOT_should NOT_immediately NOT_find NOT_some NOT_companionship . He realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together . Mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting . My only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending . I really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times . I appreciate the fact that mckellar did n't NOT_want NOT_the NOT_material NOT_to NOT_rule NOT_the NOT_film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious . However , in not NOT_telling NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_what NOT_the NOT_cause NOT_of NOT_earth NOT_'s NOT_destruction NOT_is , he 's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film . Another problem is we never see anybody panicking . I would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing NOT_to NOT_be NOT_done NOT_about NOT_it , NOT_a NOT_large NOT_segment NOT_of NOT_the NOT_population NOT_would NOT_be NOT_going NOT_out NOT_of NOT_their NOT_minds . Instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it 's new year 's eve . I just did n't NOT_buy NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_everyone NOT_had NOT_completely NOT_accepted NOT_their NOT_fate . No NOT_one had the urge to \" rage against the dying of the light \" . Despite these small problems , \" last night \" is one of the best movies of the year . As opposed to the moronic \" armageddon \" , \" last night \" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty . And bruce willis never shows up to save the day .", "My husband and I recently bought a home and I really felt I needed to find some tips on being organized .

Great book for any mom who feels their house needs a little boost in the organization department", "When andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys . One of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker . Woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy 's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy . Woody succeeds in his mission , but does n't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_back NOT_to NOT_the NOT_house NOT_before al , the unscrupulous owner of al 's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector 's item and steals him . Buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend . Meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped . Al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950 's tv puppet show \" woody 's round - up \" except for a woody doll . Now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round - up gang - bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . The gang is happy about the move ; they 've been in storage for years waiting for woody . If woody does n't NOT_go NOT_with them , they 'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever . Trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered . While woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al 's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who does n't NOT_know NOT_he NOT_'s a toy . The new buzz generates the movie 's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on \" zurg 's fortress \" ( i. e. , al 's apartment building ) . The original \" toy story \" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown - up sensibility rather than the usual this - is - what - we - think - kids - want - to - hear . While most kids ' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in \" toy story \" buzz discovered that he was n't NOT_special , NOT_that NOT_he NOT_was just like everyone else . Buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy . In other words , it 's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life . Most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we 're NOT_not space rangers and we 're never going to be . \" toy story 2 \" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie . Woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic . This is another big grown - up theme : everything ends . The theme is introduced early in the movie when woody 's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp . On the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who 's dusty , broken , and forgotten . The other toys are shocked that woody has been \" shelved , \" and they worry that woody 's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt . After he 's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals . Of course , in spite of the heavy themes \" toy story 2 \" explores , it 's also very funny . Most of the laughs come from the toys ' assault on al 's toy barn and on the apartment building . The brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i 'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original NOT_without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original . Most of the vocal performances are first - rate . Tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work . However , one voice - over also stands out as horribly miscast . Kelsey grammer sounds nothing NOT_like NOT_an NOT_old NOT_prospector . Although he does a lot of voice - over work in commercials and on \" the simpsons \" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice . He does n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_range NOT_to NOT_pull NOT_off NOT_a NOT_role NOT_like NOT_stinky NOT_pete . The animation is even better than in the first . Especially impressive were the textures of the figures . We can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint . We can also see that bo peep is porcelain . As you can tell from the long - winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- \" disney and pixar 's ' toy story 2 ' \" -- this is pixar 's coming out party . To celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie . They made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then . On the downside , \" toy story 2 \" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag . Overall , though , i had a great time and found \" story 2 \" to be a worthy successor to the first \" toy story . \" Bottom line : this one really is fun for the whole family !", "Right , so , you 're reading this either because you are a big Oasis fan and realize that this album is wonderful , or because you 've heard some Oasis songs on the ever - disappointingly - dull radio and it 's sparked yer interest .   \" The Masterplan \" is a compilation of Oasis B - Sides that have been released over the years .   What has always made Oasis the best band in the world is the fact that the songs that they include on their \" albums proper \" are not NOT_necessarily NOT_their NOT_best NOT_songs .   As such , songs like \" Acquiesce \" , \" Talk Tonight \" and \" Stay Young \" are vacant on their albums , yet they represent the best of this lovely band and are included   here in stunning fashion .

They always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had . That was the problem that plagued these clones , not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_actual NOT_sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film . But , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it 's director brett rainer . Rush hour features jackie chan in his first u. s. action movie , playing a chinese detective who 's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate 's daughter . Of course , the fbi is upset that he 'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that 's chris tucker . What makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker . Tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( \" i 'm michael jackson , you tito . \" ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as some terrific fight scenes . The story 's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao . At least it 's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized . A particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is funny and energetic at the same time . And the finale 's a real treat as well ... chan Delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop . Rush hour is just the sort of film you 'll get a kick out of on any night of the week . Just make sure you do n't NOT_look NOT_for anything culturally different and you 'll be fine- drunken master ii this ai n't .", "More than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . During the 1950 's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \" ben - hur . \" \" cleopatra . \" \" the robe . \" \" sparticus . \" \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \" quo vadis . \" Sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . Since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small - screen affairs produced in the 1970 's ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . Yet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a. d. 180 . Roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . However , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . When commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . Maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . A caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus ' place is never explained . ) An african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus ' wounds . Proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . Of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . When commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . Our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus ' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . The similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . Also , like mel gibson 's epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero 's anger . It 's a simple tale of good versus evil . Maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . Commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . The opening night crowd in my theater was about 70 % male , and that seems appropriate . \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . There 's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) Lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . Joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . In the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father 's love or pride . Throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who 's scripted as a caricature of evil . I 've been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" This role does n't NOT_offer NOT_him NOT_the NOT_complexities NOT_of NOT_his NOT_parts NOT_in \" NOT_l. NOT_A. NOT_confidential \" NOT_and \" NOT_the NOT_insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . The late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . I hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . My only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . Several scenes are tinted . We 've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" I do n't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_appeal NOT_of NOT_the NOT_style , NOT_which NOT_makes NOT_feature NOT_films NOT_look NOT_like NOT_tv NOT_ads . In \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic . ( perhaps it 's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer - generated shots . ) Also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half - blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) With a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . Bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices .", "Lovely Hotel . This is our fourth visit to Rome and the first time to stay at Hotel Bailey 's . Four of us stayed here during the weekend of Valentine 's day and Wales v Italy in Rugby . The hotel was excellent and some of the comments below running the hotel down is hard to believe . The two bedrooms we had on the 5th floor were large . spotlessly clean and pleasantly decorated . Staff were friendly and helpful and location hotel although slightly off the main road was within easy walking distance of major attractions . We found an excellent restaurant on the same road . ca not NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_name but it had a large yellow sign outside W would come back to this hotel again as others we have stayed in did not NOT_come anywhere near to the high standard of the Bailey 's p s.

Three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making .

The reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape - to - film transfer done for the big screen .

Read all five books in order .   The Man in the Iron Mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context .   Think of the Man in the Iron Mask as the dessert in a five course meal .   Dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable .   Getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that I was finishing a 3,500 page experience.2 .   Read the Oxford University editions .   There are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events .   When you read 3,500 pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight .   The Introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter.3 .   If you really like any one book in particular , go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection .   I purchased a used Three Musketeers with illustrations by Maurice Leloir .   The three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable . Along with Sir Walter Scott , Alexandre Dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel .   I have been reading these types of novels my entire life .   Beyond a doubt , Alexandre Dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre .", "Good deal and a neat . quirky stay .

Based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . However , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . Frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner 's story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . Through edgecomb 's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . From an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind - hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . The plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . The performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . The ensemble acting in the film is perfect . Hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . They are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . They are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . The more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . Some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . Hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . Every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . It would come as no NOT_surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not NOT_only NOT_because NOT_he NOT_did NOT_a NOT_wonderful NOT_job NOT_as NOT_wetmore , NOT_but NOT_also NOT_because NOT_he NOT_stole NOT_every NOT_scene NOT_he NOT_was NOT_in NOT_away NOT_from NOT_veteran NOT_oscar NOT_winner NOT_tom NOT_hanks . Rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . As a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . This irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . The last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . Duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child - like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . His desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no NOT_just NOT_cause . His pain creates pain for the viewer . However , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . The film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at \" the jerry springer show . \" The scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . Not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_this NOT_observation NOT_entirely NOT_pointless NOT_and NOT_out NOT_of NOT_place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . As the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without NOT_any NOT_introduction . His death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . Greene is not NOT_even NOT_given NOT_a NOT_final NOT_word , NOT_like NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_characters , and we do n't NOT_even NOT_see NOT_him NOT_walk NOT_the NOT_infamous NOT_green NOT_mile . However , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . The speed in \" the green mile \" is perfect . If time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_know NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_as NOT_they NOT_are or as they treat others . The three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \" the green mile \" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not NOT_to NOT_feel NOT_some NOT_sort of sadness for every person in this scene . Fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely NOT_succeeded NOT_in doing .

That said , drop any pre - conceived notions of what shakespeare 's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african - american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon - levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey 's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca 's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short . With movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic - romance . Yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage . The first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca 's last name : stratford . Their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman 's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly . In what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family \" no NOT_dating \" NOT_policy is amended to \" bianca can date ... when [ katarina ] does . \" With prom just ahead , bianca 's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew .

When cameron , who likes bianca , learns of her father 's new rule , he is quick to consult a friend for advice . The scheme they dream up is to fully exploit \" someone with money . \" In this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca . Cameron 's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out . The solution lies no NOT_farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . This verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison . Moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that \" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . \" The laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet .

El Nino 's first half was much better than the second , I did n't NOT_particularly NOT_like NOT_Transmigration and I defy anyone to listen to his 2001 piano work American Berserk and tell me it 's any good .   But after this release , I stand humbly corrected -- he 's still , in my opinion , America 's , if NOT_not the world 's , best living composer . Dharma at Big Sur is scored for an electric violin and orchestra and uses a tuning system that 's not NOT_well - NOT_tempered .   What really makes this work special is the way the electric violinist plays soulfully and beautifully above the orchestra for almost the entire work in a sliding style I 've never heard before in classical music .   The first movement \" A New Day \" with its quiet and contemplative opening really feels like it 's the creation of an entire universe .   The climax of the second movement might be the most satisfying conclusion to any of Adams 's works to date .   Dharma is an absolute masterpiece . My Father Knew Charles Ives is wonderful too , even if it NOT_'s not as powerful or moving as Dharma .   The work is both an homage to Ives and a reflection of Adams ' life .   Clearly , Adams had a great childhood .   The first movement , Concord , is playful -- the clearest tribute to Ives , since it 's sounds structurarlly similar to his Fourth of July .   The chaos in Adams ' Concord is a little more rigid than Ives ' , but it 's still fun .   The second movement , \" The Lake \" , features a beautiful clarinet line that evokes the composer 's father .   The scurrying of the last movement , \" The Mountain \" , seems needlessly frenetic at times , but the cathartic ending that results of it makes the voyage worth it . My one bone to pick is with Nonesuch .   The two works together represent about 52 minutes worth of music -- an amount that many would already consider stingy on a single CD , especially when other works like Guide to Strange Places go unrecorded .   So why put these two works on 2 CDs ?   Is it to justify the $ 20 sticker price ?   An artistic statement to completely separate the two works ?   It just seems silly .   But it 's also forming a nasty pattern of sub-30 minute CDs that really should stop .   People want to hear the astonishing sound world that Adams creates -- why try to limit it to 25 minutes at a time?Buy this disc , even if it 's split into 2 pieces .   It 's the best of his works yet", "As a Social Worker in private psychotherapy practice , I find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at times I question whether I should make more of an effort to consider the latest trends in psychotherapy . Mary Pipher affirms that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as compassion , empathy , listening skills , reframing and the ability to induce a sense of calm are timeless . Furthermore , even if I NOT_was n't a therapist I think I would still devour this book because her writing is a pleasure to read . I highly recommend it for anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have been in the field for decades .

The first six novels in the series ( that is all I have read , though it appears that there are two or three more ) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the Arthurian legend .

These books will not NOT_insult NOT_your NOT_intelligence , and they prove that one does not NOT_need NOT_to NOT_suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the Arthurian legend .", "\" take a number , fill out a form , and wait your turn . \" Starring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen It might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone . It is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward . He loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays . Within a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced . A conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation . Lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm . She notes that they have n't NOT_finished NOT_paying NOT_for NOT_the NOT_bookshelves NOT_or NOT_the NOT_couch NOT_yet . He says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves . It would pass as deadpan humour if it was n't NOT_spoken NOT_with such resigned weariness . This sets the tone for the rest of the movie . There is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity . There is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing NOT_else NOT_matters . Lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion . They go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy . Their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances . The art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters ' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment . There is no NOT_suggestion NOT_of NOT_sexuality NOT_in NOT_the NOT_relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love . Their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel . It must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film 's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona 's misfortunes . Irony would be an injustice . Situations and settings are broad and exaggerated -- this is not NOT_realism -- but they are not NOT_distorted . The emotions are authentic . If it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that 's because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered . He shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty - eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two - bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife 's former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money . All this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious . If most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear . But what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely NOT_accommodates NOT_the NOT_96-minute NOT_running NOT_length . I have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not . It does not NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing . It is not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_will NOT_be NOT_seen NOT_by NOT_a NOT_large NOT_audience , NOT_because NOT_it NOT_can NOT_not NOT_be NOT_pitched NOT_to NOT_one . There is no selling point . It is all understatement , restraint , melancholy . The characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills . This does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore . It engages us and touches us and resolves -- surprisingly , and movingly -- into something resembling a happy ending . The only thing greater than the ill - luck that governs the characters ' lives is their refusal to give in to despair . Their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a \" feel - good \" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned .", "Waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : ` after all , we 're human . ' In the context of events to transpire , joe 's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film . Does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ? Through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility . Expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria . In the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar . Deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob 's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip . We see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar . What is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no NOT_longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse . What once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless . To the audience , the deputy 's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob 's delirium crescendos . Lang educes this discomfort not NOT_through NOT_movement NOT_of NOT_the NOT_camera , but rather its stillness . The shot 's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions . As the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well . The stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality . Because the camera does not NOT_track NOT_the NOT_deputy NOT_'s NOT_movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability . As the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob . This shot is unique because it is a point - of - view shot where the audience , not NOT_a NOT_character in the film is the subject . While a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob 's belly distorts the audience 's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large . We see close shots of people 's faces , contorted by their rage . With the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching . In this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang 's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail . In some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind . Lang 's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior . As joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side . Lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts . Using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man 's volatility and ` impulse ' towards inconceivable cruelty . Reprising joe ' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .", "One of the things I like about this book for young readers is that the same vocabulary words are repeated throughout the series so that the kids can build on what they learned in one book while they 're reading the next . At first , I was disappointed with the series since I did n't NOT_think NOT_it NOT_did justice to the Little House series that I treasured myself as a girl .   After a few reads , however , I see that the magic of Laura Ingalls Wilder 's stories shines through in this series with Renee Graef 's illustrations .   How else do you explain to a four - year - old what a log cabin is really like ?   I am surprised how many \" How .. \" and \" Why ... \" questions this series has provoked .   Regarding this book in particular , my daughter asked about a million questions about the maple syrup - making process", "Jerry springer has got nothing NOT_on \" NOT_wild NOT_things . \" John mcnaughton 's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer 's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator - wrestling , they 're all part of the movie 's raucous , complex storyline . But even trash tv topicality ca n't NOT_drag \" wild things \" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you 'd find late - night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . Despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there 's wicked fun to be had here . \" wild things \" would be a guilty pleasure , only there 's no NOT_guilty NOT_feeling NOT_involved in having a good time with it . High school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well - liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave 's most financially prominent . Hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo 's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . Before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin - vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly 's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . Lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace - sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . The previews give away the following revelations , so if you have n't NOT_seen NOT_any of the movie 's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . While cross - examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not NOT_with NOT_her . To pay lombardo for the damages , kelly 's mother breaks her daughter 's trust fund and gives him $ 8 . 5 million . But lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . Duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there 's more afoot to the case than just false accusations . If there 's a major drawback to \" wild things , \" it 's that it 's oversexed to a fault . The much - talked - about hotel room menage - a - trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn - off . It 's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . What we do n't NOT_see is far more effective than what we do . Another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . Er , no NOT_thanks . Also , bacon 's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . Daphne rubin - vega , from broadway 's \" rent , \" tries to compensate for a superfluous character . Theresa russell is just plain wooden . And when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . But what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) NOT_that NOT_never NOT_seems to end . \" wild things \" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over - the - top nasty that you ca n't NOT_help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . A great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray 's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo 's case and flipping them off . And do n't NOT_leave NOT_when NOT_the NOT_closing NOT_credits NOT_hit NOT_the NOT_screen , NOT_or NOT_you NOT_'ll NOT_miss the film 's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . Speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" Matt dillon flexes his sleepy - voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . Neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . Re - edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . But what we 're given works well enough . \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild .", "Without NOT_a NOT_car NOT_forget NOT_it . .   Our room . . . View from our balcony . . . The grounds . .   We have just returned from a 2 night stay in the Green Park Resort . Firstly I would point out that although it is supposed to be in Tirrenia - after unpacking we walked for 35mins and then only managed to reach the outskirts of the town . The complex itself is beautifully laid out - set amongst gorgeous greenery and well kept paths - however we did see some suites that had awful views of old deserted buildings and waste ground so if you book do ask for a view of the complex grounds and not NOT_a NOT_scene NOT_from Beirut . We stayed in a double superior room in block 4 and it was lovely . It was clean and well serviced by the maid Once outside the complex however it was not NOT_so NOT_pretty . I would definitely not NOT_advise NOT_anyone NOT_to NOT_stay NOT_here NOT_unless NOT_they NOT_had NOT_a NOT_car . There is no NOT_taxi NOT_service - when we asked about this at reception we were told we had to pay for a cab to drive out from Pisa . 20 euro . and then wherever else on top of that . There is a bus stop 200 metres along the busy main road . beside the only shop for miles - a tabacconist .   where you purchase your bus ticket The breakfast was great but we did not NOT_use NOT_the NOT_hotel NOT_restauants NOT_at NOT_night NOT_because NOT_they NOT_appeared NOT_to NOT_be NOT_deserted . We walked along the main road until we found a restuarant on the 1st night and the walk back was a truly awful experience - no NOT_footpath . crazy drivers . no NOT_street NOT_lights NOT_and NOT_really NOT_eerie . The 2nd day we caught the bus into Tirrenia and ate there early in the evening and were back before nightfall . Having read in another review about reception disputing the price on checking out I had taken a copy of our booking confirmation and sure enough they did try to charge us double when it came to leaving . When I produced the relevant documents clearly stating the total price for our 2 night stay they did cancel the transaction and redo correctly . Finally like I said I would only recommend this hotel to someone with a car and do remember to take your website booking confirmation with you to avoid the check - out dispute .", "Like many of the other reviewers here have already stated , this is a book to be read by everyone !

Being a beta type personality I loved the macro , kicked back approach he took to training . It was just what I 'd been looking for . Keeping it fun .   Thanks , Bra", "\" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . The movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien - like underwater sounds . Then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams ' now infamous score . Dah - dum . From there , director steven spielberg wastes no NOT_time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . Right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . Perhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . He works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . Unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . Until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams ' music . He 's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark 's arrival is truly terrifying . He does n't NOT_let NOT_us NOT_get NOT_bored NOT_with NOT_the NOT_imagery . The first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there has n't NOT_been NOT_a NOT_murder or a gun fired in 25 years . The island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , does n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_shut NOT_down NOT_the NOT_beaches NOT_because NOT_the NOT_island NOT_is reliant on summer tourist money . Brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . Hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it 's a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . When vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . The entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . It is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it 's no NOT_wonder NOT_it NOT_took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . Even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock 's \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . Although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none NOT_of NOT_it NOT_could NOT_improve NOT_the NOT_film NOT_because NOT_it NOT_only NOT_would NOT_lead to overkill . The technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . Scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none NOT_of NOT_them NOT_had NOT_the NOT_draw NOT_of NOT_a NOT_robert NOT_redford NOT_or NOT_paul NOT_newman . Nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . Scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what 's right and going against the entire town . \" it 's your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . Dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . However , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie 's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . Bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . He 's slightly deranged , and shaw 's performance is almost a caricature . However , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . Quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u. s. s. Indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . His tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair - raising than anything spielberg put on screen . Shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . Of course , we ca n't NOT_leave NOT_out NOT_the NOT_shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind 's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . A shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . Every one of spielberg 's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . The shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . Many have forgotten , but \" jaws \" was a sort of precursor to \" waterworld \" ( 1995 ) , a movie 's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . But , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare - thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .", "Jacques tati 's 1953 classic \" les vacances de m. hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot 's vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . The characters hardly NOT_ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week 's vacation . Yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . Part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . Slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face - first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people do n't NOT_watch where they 're going . In \" les vacances de m. hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low - key . In one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . While crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . When he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . Tati does n't NOT_waste NOT_a NOT_single NOT_opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . It has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience 's expectations , and \" les vacances de m. hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . Tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . When hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no NOT_fights NOT_or NOT_shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . Tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than NOT_not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he 's not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . For example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot 's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel 's lights coming on one by one . Then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not NOT_give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . The ending is one of two elements that really make this a four - star film as opposed to merely an above - average , clever comedy . As much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . The other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . It easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . Instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \" les vacances de m. hulot \" is not NOT_subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not NOT_terribly NOT_essential NOT_to the flow of events . Anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . Note : \" les vacances de m. hulot \" was not NOT_rated NOT_by the mpaa . It would at most receive a pg rating .", "Charles H. Kahn 's account of the Pythagorean philosophical tradtion , although less than 200 pages long , is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality . In a concise , but intelligent , summary , Kahn traces Pythagoreanism from its semi - legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as Copernicus and Kepler . As a young academic who specialises in the Pythagorean tradition I can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars , but as a Latinist I must say I was disapointed by Kahn 's treatment ( or lack of ) of this strand of Western philosophy in late Roman and Medieval thought . But , this is still the best up to date history of Pythagoreanism available in the English language", "I love almost all of these songs on this cd .

The   insights of the average person living in Germany are of great importance to   both social and military historians alike . Steinhoff offered this   collective testament as a warning to all of us regarding war and the rise   of a dictator . As Johannes said in an interview , & quot;It is always the   civilians who suffer the most , yet are remembered the least.&quot", "The andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made . I know that is very sweeping statement , so i 'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of \" science fiction , \" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot . 2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science . Most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting . The andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high - tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town . Something bad happens to them . Pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight . Apparently everyone in the town is dead . The authorities call a \" wildfire alert , \" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super - secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada . Two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins . Some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive . They take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a \" directive 712 , \" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb . What they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth - like life and mutates as it grows . Their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict . What they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a - bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet . They barely NOT_call NOT_off NOT_the NOT_bombing NOT_in NOT_time . But then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out . This triggers the lab 's last - ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb . To those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow . Much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts . But what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw . The performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low - key and restrained , just like scientists . To me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting . We follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we do n't NOT_expect . This film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it . It was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body 's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .", "This book turns the entire concept of intelligence inside out . Seriously mind - blowing . Excellent exercise in extended mental gymnastics . You wo n't NOT_be NOT_disappointed", "Kevin smith is like a big kid . His humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile 's . He grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few . He also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith 's own fellow adolescent - minded grownups . Smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong . Kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he 'll be the first to tell you that . That might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy - handed . Great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them . This was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well . That is not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_smith NOT_'s NOT_message NOT_is NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_one . In dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god 's desires is superior to anyone else 's . Basically , dogmatism is bad . Changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or NOT_not . This is not NOT_exactly NOT_a NOT_new NOT_message NOT_in NOT_movies ( NOT_see NOT_inherit NOT_the NOT_wind ) , but i have no NOT_problems NOT_with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma 's protesters are proving smith 's point . Smith 's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book . But this is smith 's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns . The story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) . Along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany 's aid . Fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind - the - scenes manipulator for all the chicanery . The logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith 's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum . Among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men . Of course , kevin smith does not NOT_necessarily NOT_subscribe NOT_to NOT_these NOT_ideas NOT_himself . They are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic . Smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie . When harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters ' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke . The film 's humor is uneven . Some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning - bush kind of entrance . But many of the film 's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek 's serendipity . Also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away . Still , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace . Among the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far . Fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight . Damon and affleck are fairly lackluster . Rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith . But the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith 's movies , are much more in line with smith 's brand of humor . Bud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances .", "I 'll have to accept that even tough I 'm not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release , the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there .

August ' 07 . . . Duke Hotel . August ' 07 . . More photos . . We have just returned from 5 days in Rome . having stayed at ' The Duke ' . From the moment we stepped out of the private car from the airport . which The Duke reception arranged for us by email prior to leaving the UK . everyone was just fantastic .   Everyone on reception was friendly . polite and very professional . but this also applied to any of the hotel staff that we met . The room was excellent very spacious and extremely clean The bathroom had everything you would expect with a nice powerful shower to wake you up after a great nights sleep . I would say that the location of The Duke is one of it 's best strengths . When you get back to the hotel you were guaranteed a good nights sleep due to the hotel 's location and compfortable bed . As people have mentioned there is an excellent shuttle bus service . usually driven by Luigi . a very nice friendly guy . and should generally be booked the day beforeTip 1 . We used to always get the shuttle bus into the main area each day . but would always get a taxi back to the hotel . This meant that you could keep costs down . but you did not NOT_have NOT_to NOT_rush NOT_back NOT_to NOT_meet NOT_the NOT_shuttle NOT_bus NOT_if NOT_you NOT_were NOT_accross NOT_town . A taxi was approx 10 euro from most areas of the town to the DukeTip 2 . Piazza Navona is a great place to go in the evening . with an excellent choice of restaurants to choose from . approx 10 - 15 minutes walk from the Spanish steps Tip 3 Try the ice cream from one of the ' Blue Ice ' parlours . In summary I would highly recommend The Duke to anyone . and would not NOT_hesitate NOT_to NOT_go NOT_back NOT_there NOT_when NOT_we NOT_return NOT_to NOT_Rome .", "Reminds me that conservation has been in the minds of some for a very long time .   My grandson who is four loved the story and understood the concept", "You 've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . The title is generic . It 's meaningless . And i ca n't NOT_believe NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_good NOT_business . When you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean - claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? Yuck . The movie itself deserves your attention . For sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands - down . Only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i 'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it 's not NOT_as NOT_slick NOT_as NOT_the NOT_tom NOT_cruise NOT_picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . Much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . His track record is n't NOT_as NOT_solid NOT_as NOT_schwarzenegger NOT_'s , but he 's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . In 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong 's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo 's radically different director 's cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) This follow - up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo 's more operatic offerings . The surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo 's subsequent broken arrow . Here 's the rundown . Van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean - hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that 's alain 's exact double . Turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . Alain does some investigating . He finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . Assuming michael 's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael 's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . That 's as much as you need to know . The story is adequate , but not NOT_overly NOT_involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . There 's a love story , too , but i did n't NOT_find NOT_it NOT_terribly NOT_convincing , NOT_partly NOT_because NOT_ex - NOT_model NOT_henstridge NOT_is too high - strung in her high - profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . She 's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here ca n't NOT_really NOT_be NOT_described as \" acting . \" Of course , \" acting \" is n't NOT_really NOT_what NOT_she NOT_was NOT_hired NOT_for ( NOT_i NOT_lost NOT_track NOT_of NOT_whether NOT_her NOT_shirt NOT_comes NOT_off NOT_more NOT_often NOT_than NOT_van NOT_damme NOT_'s ) . The movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) The stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme 's stand - in makes his work no NOT_less impressive . There 's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile - ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . And lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . The main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double - barreled points of view to make things run . Do n't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong -- NOT_when NOT_chow NOT_yun - NOT_fat NOT_soars NOT_through NOT_space NOT_pumping NOT_bullets NOT_out NOT_of NOT_two NOT_pistols NOT_and NOT_chewing NOT_on NOT_a NOT_toothpick NOT_with NOT_glass NOT_and NOT_confetti NOT_littering NOT_the NOT_air NOT_around NOT_him NOT_in NOT_woo NOT_'s NOT_hard - NOT_boiled , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_an NOT_amazing NOT_moment . But it 's a moment that 's hard to reproduce in hollywood . ( for one thing , hollywood does n't NOT_yet NOT_have NOT_chow NOT_yun - NOT_fat ! ) While woo 's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . The very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam 's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . The film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam 's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . The performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there 's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie does n't NOT_always NOT_overcome NOT_the NOT_limitations NOT_of NOT_its NOT_genre . The story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme 's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . But it 's not NOT_often NOT_that NOT_hollywood NOT_cranks NOT_out NOT_a NOT_truly NOT_satisfying NOT_action NOT_picture , and it 's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . Van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man 's best movie , and international action buffs will no NOT_doubt savor this flavorful hong kong / hollywood hybrid .", "A. to Sofital .

Interestingly , Lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of Syrian occupation .   They have gone from the vegan dictator Hafez Assad murdering opponents and journalists to the Syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists ( another killed last week 7/2005).In this review , I will attempt to explain the story , the left - wing / doves reporter 's views ( and on so many levels his mistakes ) , and most importantly to Americans who love and support Israel , the correlation between Israel 's actions and our \" War on Terror . \"First to the journalists , the main one being the left wing newspaper Haraatz Ze'ev Schiff .   As the brilliant reviewer givbatam3 points out nearby , Mr. Schiff is a member of the Israeli left / dove / Peace Now group .   This \" coalition \" consists of myopic people ( with all due respect ) that do n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_understand good and evil .   Just as our great President Bush was criticized for denouncing the \" Axis of Evil \" ( he forgot to mention Syria and the House of Saud ) , these doves conveniently choose to ignore the problems with cooperating with our / their enemies .   This is what lead to the fraudulent Oslo accords and the creation of the terrorist supporting Palestinian Authority .   It is this \" authority \" that unleashed a wave of terror on Israel immediately after Clinton helped the murderer Arafat receive a Nobel Peace Prize .   Fittingly , Arafat walked away from the Clinton / Barak   plan in 2000 , which would have created a Palestinian state , which to this day ( 7.8.05 ) does not NOT_exist despite the charade of the Road Map .   The authors accuse Prime Minister Sharon of illegally leading Israel into the war in Lebanon .   Most of the books I 've read about Israel seem to have been written by journalists out to discredit Sharon .   He seems to be the Donald Rumsfeld of Israel .   I do n't NOT_live NOT_there so it is impossible for me to get a read on the situation , but he WAS democratically elected , so most of the voters must disagree with the left 's assessment of Mr. Sharon ( yes , I know his \" disengagement \" is an illegal abomination , more on that later .   Wear Orange to support the settlers.)On page 39 , Mr. Ze'ev describes Sharon as \" a cynical , headstrong executor who regarded the IDF as his personal tool for obtaining sweeping achievements - and not NOT_necessarily defensive ones - and a minister prepared to stake the national interest on his struggle for power . \"   Those would prove to be the \" kindest \" words he would have for Mr. Sharon .   On page 58 , he accuses Sharon of implementing a quasi - coup d'etat . And on and on it goes .   The author also accuses Sharon of duping the American government , details forthcoming . Later on , we learn of the \" courageous , freedom fighter \" ( my emphasis ) Arafat 's decision to deploy all Palestinians including 12 year old boys to kill Israelis .   Of course , to this day the PA affiliated Fatah and other groups use children to murder Israeli civilians ( the best non - child attack recently was the Palestinian woman who was granted permission to receive medical care in Israel who tried to kill innocent Israeli doctors / nurses using \" bomber pants . \"   Great video of her discovering the bomb would n't NOT_activate , however US MSM { mainstream media } other than FOX refused to air it.)On page 92 , we learn of Arafat crony and current PA leader Abu Mazen 's ( the same Oslo and Road Map violating , terrorist supporting / enabling , holocaust denying , chain - smoking Mazen that GW brazenly brought to the White House ) recommendation to target specific ethnic types of Jews for murder . Throughout the story , if indeed the cabinet was mislead , we learn that this deception had negative military preparedness consequences .   Specifically , a failure to call up the reserves . To his credit and unlike journalists Robert Fisk ( Pity the Nation ) and Thomas Friedman ( NY Times , From Lebanon to Jerusalem ) , Mr. Schiff reminds us of the level of terror practiced by Ray - Ban Wayfarer wearing Arafat even inside his own PLO .   On page 147 , we learn of Palestinians killing Palestinians that were given the chance to evacuate an area prior to IDF action .   In this episode , three children were gunned down in front of their father . On page 149 , the authors engage in a disgusting bit of analysis about the minds of IDF members .   In discussing a particularly brutal phase of the operation , the author 's ask \" was it perhaps fueled by an even deeper sense of vengeance for all the harm and hatred that the Jews had suffered at the hands of others over the centuries ? \"   And further , \" How would the grandparents of these boys have reacted to the scene of mayhem ... ? \"   Are you kidding me ? ?   These members of the citizen army were probably quite sick of repeated murders of innocent Israeli citizens and committed to seeing their country living in peace .   Meanwhile , the UN , the left / doves , the media , and others seemed to downplay or turn a blind eye to Arafat 's involvement in the many terrorist attacks conducted by the PLO prior to the Lebanon operation .   In my humble view , something had to be done .   Prime Minister Begin agreed with Sharon 's initial plan on eliminating the terrorists in Beirut . Page 152 features more America bashing , culminating in an accusation that the US was an Israeli dupe . The story of the military operation is detailed completely .   And no NOT_discussion NOT_of the Lebanon operation would be complete NOT_without mentioning the incidents in the refugee camps in Sabrit and Shatilla .   I 'll leave it for the reader to decide on this operation , but in short , Israel relied on their \" allies \" in Lebanon to rid the camps of terrorists .   Most assuredly , after the Palestinians brought havoc to these people , they wanted revenge .   The result : some civilian deaths to go along with the \" clean up \" operation and a rebuke of several Israeli figures including Prime Minister Sharon .   Folks , war is not NOT_pretty and the US faced similar choices in partnering with the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan .   Many to this day say that is why we allegedly \" lost \" Bin Laden in Tora Bora instead of adequately deploying our troops on the Pakistan border .   General Tommy Franks says this would not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_possible and I believe him more than the Kerry / Kedwards crowd .   Our \" ally \" Pakistan would not NOT_have NOT_tolerated NOT_a NOT_US NOT_presence , NOT_given NOT_that NOT_they NOT_were NOT_one NOT_of NOT_only NOT_three NOT_governments NOT_with NOT_relations NOT_with NOT_the NOT_Taliban . As for the author 's attempts to rid Israeli society of Prime Minister Sharon , it did n't NOT_work .   He forcefully fought the charges emanating from the investigation into the Lebanon operation .   After Yasser walked all over Clinton in Barak in 2000 and launched / restarted the intifada , Israel voted for \" Arik \" and his platform of not NOT_negotiating NOT_with Arafat .   Sadly , no NOT_tragically , he is haphazardly implementing his \" disengagement plan . \"   Six weeks prior to its start , it appears the plan is not NOT_well NOT_thought NOT_out and polls show that Israelis are increasingly against it .   Moreover , turning land over to terrorist supporting Mazen will embolden those that seek Israel 's destruction .   Israel expects terror gangs of Hamas , Islamic Jihad , and Mazen 's own Fatah to immediately set up shop in the West Bank and begin terror operations .   So looking back Mr. Schiff and Ya'ari , who was right ?   Terror coddling doves such as Rabin ( who at least acknowledged the danger in trusting Arafat ) and Peres or Likud hawks such as Sharon ( and Netanyahu ) ?   Let the reader decide .   I know who I would trust with my security :   Likud members Sharon and Netanyahu .", "The music intelligentia probably wo n't NOT_like NOT_James NOT_Morrison NOT_'s NOT_new NOT_album NOT_because NOT_almost NOT_everybody NOT_else NOT_will NOT_love NOT_it .

But if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it 's excellent . Boogie nights falls into the latter catagory . The director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along . Mark whalberg , a. k. a Marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain ' gift ' in the midriff area . Jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business . After running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies . In the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h. macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script . We learn about ambers grief about not NOT_being NOT_able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband . But the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing . The direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up .

Like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift . Also , the costumes are great . The clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties . The film , although excellent , does have some flaws . Firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , can not NOT_do NOT_highly NOT_scenes NOT_which NOT_require NOT_him NOT_to NOT_be NOT_angry . In both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so ' off ' , the scenes tension and anger is lost . But the rest of the cast are excellent . Burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h. macy is great aswell ( but he always is . ) Another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on . It seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly . It 's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced . But they 're small niggles really . Boogie nights is an excellent film . Superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film .

So I suggest , to people who were in a similar position as me to also have a look at Hornback or McMurry . The text is nt an \" Advanced \" textbook perse ( after a good grounding in the basics for three days , I found this book quite user friendly ) , its organization is completely different to most other o - chem textbooks and its presentation of ideas is purely mechanistic . Both of which are ideally good things for chemistry majors who require the quintessential knowledge of structure and its impact on function and reactivity . An examples is that when introducing orbitals , and orbital interaction ; Greeves et al quickly go to HOMO and LUMO based discussions and their impact on bonding and antibonding . Wade and McMurry leave this , one of the most important principles in defining nuclephiles and electrophiles till later . A second example would be the appropriate structural implications of nucleophiles and electrophiles with respect to vacant orbitals , lone pairs and charge . These are the things used to identify em . As such , the book is nt fragmented . Each chapter has its specific niche topic and thereofore individuals get a complete understanding of various topics and their implications on the overall organic chemistry . Chapters are well referenced so if , say you are only interested in NMR then you can skip chapters and read only those pertaining to that subject and yet still get a good understanding . Most textbooks act like a stupid monologue , miss a passage and you 'd completely miss organic chem . The chapter on reaction mechanisms is excellant , it actually is better than most primers developed in explaining this concept ( i.e. Jacobs ) . However , the organization and the concentration of information within chapters may be daunting to individuals who have nt had enough experience in general chemistry . Principles of structure and reactivity are assumed knowledge . Organic chemistry in most universities are taken by biology and chemistry majors . FOr individuals who are only doing one unit of organic chemistry ; I would suggest you look elsewhere . A substitute ( a less difficult but equally comprehensive textbook for people lacking experience in chemistry ) is Hornback 's which is renowned for its lucid mechanistic explantion of organic chemistry .", "A lot of music fans have mused over why Matthew Sweet did not NOT_achieve greater success with the masses despite his obvious ability to write very catchy songs . \" Sick of Myself \" single - handedly rejuvenated my faith in the power of pop music at a time when pop seemed to have exhausted its possibilities .

There are some truly impressive ( albeit derivative ) stuff here : \" What Matters \" is in my opinion the greatest Byrds song never written , \" Hide \" is a beautiful piano ballad that would n't seem out of place on Badfinger compilation , \" If Time Permits \" has some of the most beautiful chorus harmonies not written by Brian Wilson , etc . etc . \" I 've Been Waiting \" works well in combining catchy melody with plaintive adolescent desire , and \" Girlfriend \" is for the most part a great rocker . However , after the relatively simple production of Girlfriend , his later albums got bogged down in an attempt to recreate a \" wall of sound \" feeling , which quite frankly does n't really work unless you 're Phil Spector . Not much here can be completely discounted and the new songs fit in quite well ( although I probably would have included \" Evangeline \" at the expense of \" Ready \" ) . Despite the undeniable quality of the music there is nothing life - changing here and ultimately great music must at least have the semblance of being life - changing . Still heartily recommended for fans of catchy , melodic pop - rock", "Great Choice . Like mamy users of these reviews . I try to avoid having my short holidays spoiled by selecting the wrong hotel and I read quite a few reviews before selecting Hotel Diocleziano I spent two nights there and I was really pleased with this hotel - recently renovated - opened 5 months ago - it looks just like in the photos - rooms were spotless - breakfeast was very good - staff were very helpful - I booked a Superior room - the jacuzzi - type bath is very nice having spent a long day strolling around RomeLocation is very convenient - just a few minutes walk from Station - drop off your bags and off you go - same when you leave - collect your bags - short walk to station - hop on your Train to the airport . 30 minutes later you are there and ready to check in - could not NOT_be NOT_easier NOT_Probaly NOT_writing this reviw will make it harder to get a room next time - but anyway they deserve a good review .", "I think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not NOT_i NOT_am NOT_a NOT_fan of the x - files . First , let me assure you that no NOT_prior NOT_experience NOT_with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . The producers are not NOT_stupid , NOT_making NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_just NOT_for NOT_fans NOT_of NOT_the NOT_series NOT_is NOT_not NOT_profitable . You have to reach for a larger audience . Therefore , the movie is quite user - friendly . Altough , non - fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . But fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . You will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . In any case , the answer is no . I am not a fan of the x - files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . However , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie 's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . I taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . Everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . I know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . Warning : major spoilers follow ! Please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . You have been warned . The x - files is what a summer should be . Exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . This is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . From start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . When i compare it with last summer 's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face / off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . This flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . In fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . You might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! The last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . You know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? So yeah , the x - files is scary . And guess what ? You never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . Do not think that the x - files is a monster movie . In fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . No , the x - files is definately a mulder episode of the series . Scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . She has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . No , this is mulder 's time in the spotlight . By now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . If you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let 's just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . To those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there ... who Cares ! ? If he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? The dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . The camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . The script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . If you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i can not stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! Unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . Miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . Also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies ... do n't ! The person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . There is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? ) the x - files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . Who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? So far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i 'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . But the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x - files is . What more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? Cool effects ? It 's good some . Pulse pounding ? Hell yes ! Strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non - fans will have a good time . It does not provide answers to the show 's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . Rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" Moments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . You may wonder where this movie lost half a star . Well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . It 's pretty obvious the film 's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .", "Synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case . If she can survive the demanding s. e. a. l. Training , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps . Throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie . Review : the title of this movie turned me off at first . I mean ' gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ? The other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i 'm concerned . I went into this movie not NOT_liking NOT_the NOT_title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor . To my surprise i really enjoyed the movie . Moore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men . The storyline is simple . Anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push . Using feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s. e. a. l. Training . Jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength . The training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch . Nonetheless , it 's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero / heroine along in his / her endeavours . Sure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer . Stepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being NOT_nothing more than a brutal screamer . His character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character . Jordan 's boyfriend royce is also in the military . Although they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has . Royce ( what is his surname ? Do we care ? ) Almost resents jordan 's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe - eyed and supportive . His character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_lesbian NOT_to NOT_want to be in the military . In parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it 's hard not NOT_to NOT_cringe . I still liked it though . Weaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood . As we watch jordan 's battle , it 's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle . This is an individual 's fight for self - advancement . We do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_feel NOT_uncomfortable NOT_because NOT_we NOT_'re NOT_having NOT_ideology NOT_thrust NOT_down NOT_our NOT_throats . It 's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination NOT_without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or NOT_not .", "I actually discovered this book accidentally . It was in the \" return to stock \" section of my Borders Book store and I was perusing the many books people had been interested in . The summary caught my attention , but it was the first page that drew me in . Even from the beginning this book is captivating . It 's thrilling , tragic , heart - breaking , and even at times so amusing . Greer has a talent for making Max seem so real . I could n't NOT_stop NOT_reading NOT_it . It 's so hard to put down ! Definitely one the best books I 've ever read .", "I am not NOT_sure NOT_about NOT_my NOT_baby , but I love this CD ! Actually baby loves it too but probably not NOT_to NOT_that NOT_great NOT_extent . : -", "I bought this CD before going to see MMW ( with John Scofield ) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7 , 2006 .   I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue 's website .   So I bought a ticket and wanted to get \" Out Louder \" , which I knew they were going to play , to familiarize myself , but the store I was at was out of it .   So I bought \" End of the World \" instead .   While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first , I still liked the overall funkiness of it all .   THEN .... I saw them PLAY .   You MUST see them PLAY ! !   I did n't NOT_ever NOT_want NOT_it NOT_to NOT_end ! I immediately wanted to see them again !   It 's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD 's ( \" Out Louder \" and Scofield 's \" A - Go - Go \" which they \" back \" him on ) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I 'm writing this .   I 'm like an ADDICT now !   I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house .   I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they 're on and all is right with my world again .   I must say I like \" Out Louder \" and even \" A - Go - Go \" better than \" End of the World \" , but only slightly .   It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players , and I do like it better after a few listens .   I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians", "It 's a curious thing - i 've found that when willis is not NOT_called NOT_on NOT_to NOT_carry the whole movie , he 's much better and so is the movie . Even though , in the sixth sense he is the \" name \" , he does n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_pivotal NOT_role . That honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts . If osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be NOT_nothing more than a movie - of - the - week , thankfully , osment is not NOT_only NOT_better NOT_than NOT_that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance . We get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i 've seen this year . The whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter . One thing about this movie , its target . This is n't NOT_a NOT_sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i 'd call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup . One caveat : there 's a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen . I was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no NOT_biases . If anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , do n't NOT_let NOT_them . Let the director explain on his own pace and you 'll enjoy the movie vastly more .", "I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_about NOT_all NOT_that NOT_other NOT_nonsense NOT_the NOT_reviewer NOT_before NOT_me NOT_is NOT_talking about ( sounds like someone with an axe to grind)but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship . The music is inspired , the melodies transcending , and the emotion - deep and meaningful . As far as \" copying Yanni \" goes , well - I do n't NOT_agree , in fact , Yanni is far more generic and less inspired . The sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact NOT the same nor , are they Yanni 's creation . I write this review to commend mr farish on his work , and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and could n't NOT_resist NOT_his NOT_own NOT_urge to see his \" critique \" in print . Ryans music is distinctly his own , no NOT_question - and any similarities are tonal , and not NOT_compositional - which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of . As far as I 'm concerned , you be the judge - and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve 's and websites for music to criticize - and well , make themselves feel a little better . Personally , I would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy . All the other stuff is for hacks ! enjoy this music ! I do .", "I can hear the question already . What on earth do these two movies have in common ? To most people , not NOT_a NOT_lot , NOT_except that both are by renowned directors . As i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . But oh , how differently the packages affect their films . While \" everyone 's \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion 's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones ' script is . I left \" everyone says i love you \" not NOT_remembering NOT_a NOT_lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . I left \" the portrait of a lady \" not NOT_remembering NOT_a NOT_lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \" everyone \" features nothing NOT_allen has n't NOT_done NOT_before storywise . Woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong -- again . Similar situations happen to his family and friends . Some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . The scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . However , nothing NOT_allen has ever done prepared me for this one - of - a - kind display of sheer good spirits . In fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what 's most important . Yes , the movie would have been better -- among his very best , i think -- if it had a meatier story . But what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . And what better way to express feeling than through music ? Love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . Some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . It also helps that as usual , allen has a top - flight cast working with him . Their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not NOT_quite NOT_good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . But while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . Granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . Jane campion , too , has a top - flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_the NOT_film NOT_from NOT_being NOT_a NOT_stilted , NOT_virtually NOT_lifeless NOT_mess , NOT_albeit NOT_a NOT_visually NOT_interesting NOT_one . Campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye - filling images that linger in the mind . Unfortunately , what did n't NOT_linger NOT_in NOT_the NOT_mind NOT_for NOT_me NOT_was NOT_the NOT_story NOT_the NOT_visuals NOT_were NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_reflecting . I remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . Even worse , i do n't NOT_find NOT_myself NOT_feeling NOT_bad NOT_that NOT_i NOT_'ve NOT_forgotten . The problem , i think , lies not NOT_with NOT_the NOT_cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . It was the script that could n't NOT_convince NOT_me NOT_to NOT_care about anyone . The characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_connect with any of them . I understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . Jones ' script never simply gave me that opportunity . In the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . Unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no NOT_connection NOT_between me and the film . In the end , the movie 's one strength ended up hurting it . So here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . Why ? With both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing .", "Very nice hotel .

Interesting story and characters that I enjoyed spending time with", "This is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated . There are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood 's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story . This is the best we 've seen from disney since \" beauty and the beast \" ( 1996 ) . This film begins an unspecified time following the happily - ever - after conclusion to toy story . In the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their \" lives \" . One day , andy broke woody 's arm off , while playing with him . Woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards . Later andy 's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son 's room . Since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . Although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale . The cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , \" woody 's roundup . \" If he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . So , after andy 's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it 's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend . And so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys . There are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) . Meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) . They offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan . He is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations . The problem is , if woody escapes from al 's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage . A real effort is made in the technical department . The animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the \" cinematography \" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close - ups that really make an impression . Lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie 's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in - side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on \" jurassic park \" and \" star wars \" . The film ends with the \" failed takes \" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv . These outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film . But what in the end makes \" toy story 2 \" a memorable experience is not NOT_the NOT_jokes , NOT_its NOT_multiple NOT_parodies NOT_or NOT_marvelous NOT_animation . It is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself .

Unexpected because the first film was n't NOT_much NOT_more than a demonstration of special effects . But mostly it was unexpected because disney has n't NOT_produced NOT_anything NOT_spectacular NOT_in NOT_years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs . But here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years . This is a big step - away from the ancient laws of disney - animation . Off course , this is not \" NOT_antz \" , it is not NOT_as NOT_intelligent ; this is not NOT_a NOT_landmark NOT_and NOT_no NOT_masterpiece , but i promise that you 'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have . Whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say . My choice would probably be \" the iron giant \" , but ( along side with \" american pie \" ) this is the comedy of the year . I almost lost my hopes for disney , but \" toy story 2 \" proves that disney has n't lost their ability to entertain .", "The Edward Scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores .

We were even left a bottle of sparkling wine in your room with their compliments for New Year We will return .", "Scream 2 is n't NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_clever NOT_as NOT_its NOT_predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit . Death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no NOT_further NOT_than pulp fiction for an example ) . And , while there 's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest ' 90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had . Scream 2 is a slice - and - dice movie for those who do n't NOT_take NOT_their NOT_horror NOT_too NOT_seriously . The success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise . The unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $ 100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time . A sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber . As stipulated by one of the \" rules of sequels \" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original . Paradoxically , there 's a lot less gore . There is blood , of course , but nothing NOT_excessive NOT_by NOT_slasher - NOT_movie NOT_standards , and there are no NOT_depictions NOT_of spilled entrails . Craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids . A second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut - out stereotypes lined up for slaughter . After all , we 've known some of these people for two movies -- it 's almost impossible not NOT_to NOT_care NOT_about NOT_them NOT_at NOT_least NOT_a NOT_little . Scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original . As in the first picture , there 's a slick , self - mocking prologue . This time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the \" true life \" events of scream ) . Some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it 's surely no NOT_coincidence NOT_that , NOT_in NOT_addition NOT_to NOT_pinkett NOT_and NOT_epps , NOT_scream NOT_2 NOT_features NOT_two NOT_black NOT_characters ) . Shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders . Craven lets loose a burst of tongue - in - cheek creativity for the \" movie within a movie \" sequences . They give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache . Stab features heather graham in the \" casey becker \" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as \" sidney prescott \" ( neve campbell ) . Sadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab . It would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante 's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production . Following the prologue , we are re - introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college . Her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he 's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever . Once the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim . At the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney . She has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her . Also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations . In addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well - populated . There 's a blond co - ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson 's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney 's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale 's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would - be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) . Ultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses . From the stab scenes to lines like \" brothers do n't NOT_last NOT_long NOT_in situations like this , \" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) . Their resolution to the obligatory \" whodunit ? \" Is less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes . ( \" nice twist , \" quips the killer . \" did n't NOT_see NOT_it NOT_coming , didya ? \" ) One senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self - referential slasher film has been played out . Supposedly , there 's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers do n't NOT_come NOT_up NOT_with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill .", "All great things come to an end , and the dot - com era embodies that perfectly . Beneath a mound of bankruptcy paperwork lies the remains of a former dot - com darling , the company kozmo . com , An online convenience store stocked with ice cream , porn videos , and other basic necessities of a urban dweller , all hand - delivered by couriers within an hour . Designed in 1997 by two college roommates -- joseph parks , a 27 year old goldman sachs banker , and yong kang - kozmo flamed out in three short years , raising more than $ 280 million in venture capital funding and from partnerships with such bigwigs as starbucks and amazon . com . By december 1999 , the company boasted 4 , 000 employees in 11 cities , its barking ceo park attracting all kinds of media attention . The company was set for an ipo in may 2000 ... Until april 14 , 2000 , the day the stock market took its first big dive , ending the internet era . By april 13 , 2001 , kozmo was out of money and ceased operations . Unlike the earlier , similar documentary startup . com , which chronicled the rise and fall of another dot - com , govworks , e - dreams focuses both on its original founders , especially park , and on the common folks that ran the day - to - day operations . The contrast is amazing , showing how a cult persona can convince anyone that any idea is the next big thing . The film 's director , wonsuk chin ( too tired to die ) , expertly juxtaposes upper management company meetings with on - the - spot interviews with the bike messengers , general managers , and floor staff that kept kozmo humming . The film 's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . The most satisfying part of the film comes in understanding , to a degree , the expectations of numerous ceos commanding these titanic - type businesses . In the film 's final interviews with park , we learn what happens when the money dries up and backers do n't NOT_return NOT_phone NOT_calls . In the end , the name of the game was profit , and if you could n't NOT_make NOT_money , even the dreamers got the axe .

Ultimately , Lore can not NOT_run NOT_from NOT_her NOT_demons NOT_forever , and she must either choose to stay in the shadows or to face the truths of her past . Set in the not - NOT_so - NOT_distant future , & quot;Slow River&quot ; weaves Lore 's pasts and present together into an astonishingly compelling tale . At the heart of the book is the story of a young woman healing from abuse , and the science fiction aspects are simply the setting and enhancing details . & quot;Slow River&quot ; is the type of book that transcends whatever genre in which it 's placed : it 's more than a science fiction story , more than a coming - of - age story , more than a lesbian love story , more than a story of healing from abuse .

This book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry , what kind of people you 'll be dealing with , what the hiring pricess is like ( with particular emphasis on the interviews ) , and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired . I 'm very glad that I took the time to read this book because , after finishing it , I realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable . Obviously this is simply my own opinion , and I know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work , but nearly every single thing about it , from the superficial way applicants are screened , to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job , sounds simply awful to me . If you are considering a career as a drug rep , you should definitely do your homework to make sure it 's really something you would enjoy . This book may very well convince you that you would love it . If so , that 's great , and I hope you are successful . But if this kind of work is not NOT_right NOT_for you , this book can be equally helpful because you 'll find out by reading it what the job is really like .   There are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now , and although this one was helpful , I have to say that I think Insider 's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales by Jane Williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one . If you only buy one book , definitely buy that one instead . But if you buy two books , Pharmaceutical Landing is a good second choice . One more thing : There 's some sweet irony about this book that I just have to report . The author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants , from their shoes to their body language . He also stresses well - written resumes and cover letters . One obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it . Imagine my surprise , then , when on the very next page it says candidates should \" ... right a short paragraph ... \" about their job experiences . It seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book", "I have been a fan for Jaci Velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages .

East meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney 's parade of annual animated feature films . An odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass - market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . Though not NOT_for NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_trying . In many respects , mulan is among disney 's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . The violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child 's discarded doll , is in itself no NOT_more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan 's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? In an instant , idealistic mulan 's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . The film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family 's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger - edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . Dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney 's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian - american cast providing the film 's vocal work , there 's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . While the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo - asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i ca n't NOT_imagine NOT_that NOT_the NOT_regiment NOT_for NOT_ancient NOT_chinese NOT_warriors * NOT_really * NOT_included karate - chopping blocks of stone in two -- it 's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . The film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it 's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan 's land . At its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . As such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand - in - hand with visual purity . Scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan 's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . Mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine 's character - defining opening half - hour . It 's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . Off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive - talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience - friendly comic relief . They 're affable presences , and not NOT_precisely NOT_ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . At training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square - jawed young captain , shang . Everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not NOT_necessarily in * this * film . The romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story 's neo - feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . Another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . Composed by matthew wilder , NOT_none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i 'll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . Only \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre 's most wondrously pure voices . Nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer - generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . While the blatantly child - friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they 're not NOT_dissuasive NOT_and NOT_remain NOT_fairly NOT_enjoyable . Briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .", "I was introduced to this book while staying with a friend , and I was hooked .

Since this book , I have read several more books to learn about the teachings of Buddha", "In a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . Horrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows \" the rule of 6 . \" If you do n't NOT_break NOT_off NOT_a NOT_kiss NOT_by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . And most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has \" protection ? \" She must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . The richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . Although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . Yes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer did n't NOT_choose NOT_to NOT_name NOT_so NOT_many NOT_characters NOT_for NOT_various NOT_flowers NOT_by NOT_accident . This delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . During the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . First , he 's an average sized young lad who is slapped off - screen by his father . Next , he 's 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . When the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . William is now an average - sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . William has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free - spirited and foul - mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s. keller ) . Kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . Nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . The father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . His wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not NOT_for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . Rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine - year - old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . As the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . The director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . He takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . Rosmary 's trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . As much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . In one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . Although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . A woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . With absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch NOT_without being sensational . Dusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . All of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . The film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face - to - face with himself when younger . This causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . In the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . Even here , the director touches your heart without NOT_ever NOT_letting NOT_the NOT_story NOT_dissolve NOT_into NOT_anything NOT_approaching NOT_a NOT_tearjerker . The ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . The hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . It is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature .", "The promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . It 's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash - outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . These two spend most of the film in a drug - induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . Duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no NOT_clue NOT_who NOT_won . He leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . Fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . It does n't , NOT_even NOT_in NOT_the NOT_beginning -- NOT_while NOT_the NOT_pair NOT_'s NOT_antics NOT_are NOT_sometimes NOT_amusing NOT_and NOT_relatively NOT_harmless NOT_at NOT_first , NOT_the NOT_humor NOT_here NOT_is NOT_still NOT_fairly NOT_dark . Director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we 're laughing , we 're laughing at them rather than with them . They spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . The black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it 's probably not NOT_something NOT_most NOT_other NOT_audience NOT_members NOT_would NOT_want NOT_to NOT_experience NOT_first - NOT_hand . All this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one - hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off - kilter satire of drug culture . Thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . Now it 's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . Materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . The social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . In many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam 's most reality - based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science - fiction plot elements . Yet it is his off - the - wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . The protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke 's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . Unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not NOT_a NOT_particularly NOT_admirable NOT_figure , and neither is gonzo . During the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he does n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_approve , does n't NOT_do NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_stop NOT_it NOT_either . By the time this scene takes place , they do n't NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_hippies NOT_or NOT_peaceniks NOT_or NOT_protesters NOT_or NOT_anything NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_any NOT_more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . Duke seems to realize at some level that he 's become something he does n't NOT_like , but he 's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . This film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . While gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co - writers deserve more credit than that . There 's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the ' 60s and the objects of their rebellion just are n't NOT_usually NOT_very NOT_pleasant . Unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who 's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . In its own psychedelic , whacked - out way , it 's sad and regretful , but i think it 's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically - induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas - style materialism . Indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he 's never learned to accept that you can get higher without NOT_drugs NOT_than with them . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_any NOT_closer NOT_to NOT_accepting NOT_it NOT_by NOT_the NOT_end NOT_or NOT_not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .", "Loved the Sofitel . Honeymooned in the hotel at the beginning of August . The hotel is very . very good .

Staff - They were all friendly and helpful throughout our stay Top floor terrace - amazing view of Rome and usually empty Room - smallish but very nicely appointed and ours was a basic room . The bed was very comfy . The bathroom shower did leak if you used the handheld shower as opposed to the stand alone one but if you took care on the direction you pointed it and put a small towel down you will cover any leaking Breakfast - only ever ate the continental breakfast but found this to be very good . Also we only ever had it in the room as it was free . Taxis .   buses - cheap and plentiful . The hotel always got a taxi to the front door within minutes of asking Restaurants - lots nearby one of the best meals and very reasonably priced was a deli on the same street as the hotel which you could sit in . turn left out of the hotel and is on the same side . and it began with a ' G ' - it was as good as any restaurant we ate at Sights - really recommend you book an organised tour of the Vatican Museum SistineChapel St Peters BEFORE you get to Rome to save yourself from the unbelievably HUGE crowds .", "I took my last science course about 40 years ago and had forgotten how interesting science can be .

Like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters ' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . Also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ' ravished and wracked faces . And the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman 's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . All that is missing is a discussion of god . Which is not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_secrets & NOT_lies NOT_is NOT_nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_an NOT_homage NOT_to NOT_the NOT_swedish NOT_master . In fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . Nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film 's rhythms . Once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . One such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . Though leigh may have adopted some of bergman 's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross - cutting during a married couple 's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any \" style \" at all . Whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . The effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . It is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . Much has been made of brenda blethyn 's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . There are a few missteps . For one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . This leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . And occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . For all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . It is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . In fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . There is even a sweet but significant irony in the film 's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . Nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . Though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . Needless to say , it is also very depressing at times . But for many of us , of course , so is life . And though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .", "MariaS and Srayle , if you like the Guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the Winston ,   Personally , I think the Winston performance is refreshing and a delightful ' twist ' on Guaraldi 's works .

I was almost stunned by the quality of \" who framed roger rabbit ? \" , a fun , unique look at a world where cartoons and people lived together . \" the little mermaid \" harkened back to , and perhaps surpassed , the classic disney animations from the first half of the century . However , the endless stream of \" the little mermaid \" wanna - be 's is getting to me . You know the spiel : a lame plot recycled from some well - known story , colorful , almost psychedelic animation , the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson , the comedic sidekick / sidekicks , the seemingly unattainable love interest , a few catchy songs , a few in - jokes for adults , and the occasional out of place warner - brothers - coyote - fall - off - the - cliff type joke . It 's a formula , and like any formula , it gets tiresome . That 's why i 'm delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution rights to the works of ghibli , a japanese cartoon studio . From what i 've seen of their movies ( \" kiki 's delivery service \" and the already english - dubbed and american- distributed \" my neighbor totoro \" ) , foreign audiences are in for a treat . These movies , particularly \" kiki 's delivery service , \" are wonderfully original and entertaining . \" kiki 's delivery service \" starts with an unusual premise : kiki , upon hearing forecasts of clear skies , decides it is time for her to leave home . This is unusual because kiki is n't NOT_a NOT_college NOT_student NOT_or NOT_a NOT_young NOT_adult NOT_making NOT_her NOT_start NOT_on NOT_the NOT_world , but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training as a witch . Her mother is also a witch , and as thirteen is the obligatory age for such training , her parents treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance . Just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no NOT_mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki 's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no NOT_more NOT_than fly on a broom . Kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co - star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to . Initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding , she 's discouraged , and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skills as a witch . On the verge of leaving for a new town , she uses her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it . The favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courier , a one - persons delivery service . This is where the movie becomes shockingly good . Kiki 's job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her . The townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that does n't NOT_seem NOT_forced or artificial , but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light . They 're three- dimensional , impossible to quickly evaluate , possessing of faults , and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl . However , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique . The personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950 's . This beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at . I could probably go on all day , but i wo n't ; NOT_suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie . Some of my favorites are kiki 's relationship with the baker 's husband : although he 's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship . In the garage of a deliveree 's house can be found a vintage model t. two old ladies have a relationship evolving from master - servant to friend - friend . Such details gives the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg . Added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self - worth . Kiki initially seems to derive much of her self - worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her , but an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment , making her question the importance of such beauty . This causes kiki to lose faith in herself . However , kiki comes to realize not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_beauty NOT_of her surroundings , but the innate beauty inside her . Seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i do n't NOT_even NOT_want to hint at it . The ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney - esque moment i 've ever seen ; if you do n't NOT_hold NOT_your NOT_breath NOT_in wonder you might want to get medical attention . The movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no NOT_violence , however cartoonish , no NOT_song - NOT_and - NOT_dance NOT_number , and kiki 's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes . However , i would be surprised if disney does n't NOT_give NOT_jiji NOT_more NOT_jokes , NOT_or NOT_at NOT_least NOT_the NOT_voice of some comedian . Refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not NOT_self - NOT_contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into . \" beauty and the beast \" 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person 's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing . Kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self - image , and nothing NOT_more NOT_is NOT_made NOT_of NOT_her NOT_early NOT_desires NOT_for NOT_better NOT_clothing NOT_than NOT_illustrating NOT_her NOT_increased NOT_maturity NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . Another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for \" kiki 's delivery service \" : not NOT_as NOT_colorful NOT_and NOT_dynamic NOT_as NOT_disney NOT_animation NOT_can NOT_be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t. this is particularly true with scenes of kiki 's flights . The extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i 've ever seen . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_when NOT_or NOT_how NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_will NOT_be NOT_released NOT_in NOT_the NOT_united NOT_states . Disney tentatively plans a theater release of \" monoko hime \" shortly following the summer ' 97 japanese release , and should start releasing the other ghibli films after that . I 'd guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak seasons with no NOT_competing NOT_disney NOT_release . Although the wait is unfortunate , it 's good to know that it 's being released at all , for \" kiki 's delivery service \" is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release . Watch this movie . Along with \" man bites dog , \" and perhaps something by woody allen , this is the best movie i 've ever seen .", "The story is both true and extremely unique : The Author , who is an Austrian mountaineer and a SS Nazi officer at the same time ,   escapes from a British POW camp in India with the goal to go through Tibet to Japan - occupied Burma , to be sent back to Germany , so as not NOT_to NOT_miss his chance to participate in WWII .   The extreme difficulties of hiding from officials and surviving the wintry elements of the Himalaya mountains make his Burma plan impossible , so he stays in Tibet .   His unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the \" Forbidden City \" ( Lhassa , the capital ) , gaining employment in the Tibetian Government , becoming a friend of the \" God - King \" Dalai Lama - an extremely bright , knowledge - hungry teenager , and learning the Tibetian language to the degree which anable him to do live interpretation for Dalai Lana of English - language movies ( \" Believe me , it is not NOT_easy NOT_for NOT_a NOT_German NOT_to NOT_translate NOT_Shakespearian NOT_English NOT_into NOT_Tibetian \" ) . Going with a yak through the snows of the 20,000-feet Himalayan passes , escaping merciless robbers , manouvering between border guards - make Seven Years in Tibet a great adventure book . However , the insightful and rich observations about Tibetian people , customs , culture and politics , go far beyond   any other available information on that far - away country , and Dalai - Lama 's foreword to this book confirms this fact . The peaceful and friendly life and culture of Tibet is raped by military annexation of Tibet by China in 1951 . The ancient monasteries are destroyed , the Puritan - like culture is replaced by such crude elements of civilization as e.g. brothels for the occupying soldiers ,   Dalai Lama twice escapes to India , and so does the Author ; one third of the Tibetians die of starvation . \"Seven Tears ib Tibet \" allows us a bitter - seet inside into see a country , that lived the way how countries in medieval times lived ; also , the country trampled and largely destroyed by its aggressive neighbour .", "A Happy holiday in a great city .

There was air con in the room as well as a minibar . hairdryer . TV and modem point .

Days passed by and Maizon still did n't NOT_call .   When Margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house , that 's when Maizon calls .   Margarate was so excited that Maizon wanted to come home .   Margarate ran to the grandmother 's house telling her the news .   Margarate said Maizon wants to come home , the grandmother says that she would go get her .   When Maizon got home it was like old times , they ran into each others arms .   They then went to their favorite spot and started talking .   Maizon said she came back because she was n't NOT_being NOT_treated NOT_right , she did n't NOT_feel NOT_the NOT_same . So they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend Maizon .   I think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars .   This book has mostly everything of real life .   It deals with best friends , for example like my friendship with Kiena .   It has separation , like my sister and me .   It has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson .   I think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life , it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life .   I like this book because it reminds me of my life , me and my friends , how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking .   It reminds me of how I lose people in my family and then cry because I miss them .   If I could buy this book , I would let my whole family read it , I would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do .   This book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it .   It is so good that I really read it because I do n't NOT_really NOT_read NOT_books and when I read the book it made me think of when my best friend Ariel was going to move and how it made me feel , and how I compare it to Margarate and Maizon .   This book is excellent , the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend .   If you ask my best friend Johnniece , she 'll say that she really enjoyed the book , that it should get five stars , because the author really put thought , confidence , respect , love , care and her whole heart into this book .   When I say she put confidence in this book I meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit .   The author thought about the words , thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion .   I think that this book should be the book of the month in my school , because it shows and teaches a lesson .   With the summary I wrote I put my heart in it because when I read it , it touched my heart .   I wo n't NOT_want NOT_my NOT_friend NOT_away NOT_from NOT_me .   I think that I mostly relate to Maizon , because when she left Margarte was beginning to be liked , and the girl was talking about Maizon and Margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend .   I relate to Maizon , I relate to her because if people do n't NOT_like NOT_me , I do n't NOT_care .   If people want me out of somewhere , then I 'll leave and if people love me , I love them back and that 's how Maizon is .   She does n't NOT_take NOT_junk .   Alot of people relate to Maizon .   This book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on .   This book is really a good book that shows you friendship , break - up and everything else that deals with real life .   I love this book , it is really good and I think that if most people had this book then they would n't NOT_be NOT_out NOT_doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing .   This book really did n't NOT_grasp NOT_Dr. NOT_Kings NOT_dream NOT_because NOT_when NOT_Maizon NOT_went NOT_to NOT_Blue NOT_Hills , NOT_the NOT_whites NOT_were NOT_treating her bad , they saw her different .

The power of his voice and his personality are incomparable .   His rendition of Ave Maria is especially touching .   I would recommend this as a first buy for anyone who is new to the operatic experience , as I was so many years ago", "\" psycho meets the exorcist with no NOT_holds NOT_barred \" . A blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip - off . But no , NOT_this NOT_tacky NOT_plug NOT_comes NOT_from NOT_the NOT_poster NOT_for NOT_suspiria , NOT_perhaps NOT_italian NOT_horror NOT_director NOT_dario NOT_argento NOT_'s NOT_most NOT_consistently NOT_successful NOT_film . What impresses most in re - watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento 's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near - fully coherent narrative . Screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . No NOT_question : NOT_argento NOT_has NOT_always NOT_been NOT_a NOT_better NOT_director NOT_than NOT_a NOT_writer . Fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . The film 's storyline suffers from no NOT_major NOT_lapses NOT_in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . Jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . Arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . What happens next - and i do n't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_comparison NOT_lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock 's infamous shower scene in psycho . It 's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento 's own . Though nothing NOT_else NOT_quite NOT_equals NOT_the NOT_intensity of suspiria 's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no NOT_ordinary NOT_ballet NOT_school . We meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour - old - matriarch - from - hell roles she does so well . Several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is ... well , i would n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_spoil NOT_things NOT_now , would i ? and the film 's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that 's most impressive . The english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not NOT_just NOT_for NOT_the NOT_violence - NOT_deep NOT_red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . Fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not NOT_adversely NOT_affected NOT_the NOT_film . The dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . And the soundtrack ? It is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . As it stands , the use of goblin 's music in suspiria is outstanding . Apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . A stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer 's overall experience . Even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you 'll get the added bonus of widescreen . And the colours ! Deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . The cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . A nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . These kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento 's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . Suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . The gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that 's always been one of argento 's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .", "Those print and television ads trumpeting that \" ' grease ' is still the word \" are right on the money . To celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like \" star wars \" -- a well - deserved , red - carpet rerelease . That 's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell - it - like - it - is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ? Or the hard - nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to \" be an athletic supporter \" by rooting for the home team ? Or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- \" empty nest \" dinah manhoff ) ? And these are all probably considered minor moments ... A very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton - john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom 's most effervescently charming . For those eight of you who are n't NOT_familiar with the story , here 's a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong . Sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny 's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t - bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) . So sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back . The drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of \" greased lightening , \" the film 's big \" guy \" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but \" grease \" 's flaws amount too few to carp . The movie 's first showpiece is \" summer nights , \" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun - in - the - sun romance . Not NOT_only NOT_is \" NOT_nights \" NOT_tremendously NOT_catchy , but it 's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes . There has yet to be a live - action musical sequence that rivals the one - two punch of \" you 're the one that i want \" and \" we go together , \" \" grease \" 's euphoric cappers . All this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar - nominated \" hopelessly devoted to you \" is a lovely showcase for newton - john , and channing 's lamenting ballad \" there are worse things i could do \" is one of \" grease \" 's most unjustly overlooked tunes . The soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of \" nights \" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan - and - scanned - out choreography , but nothing NOT_else NOT_has NOT_changed -- NOT_no NOT_computer - NOT_generated NOT_backgrounds , NOT_no NOT_outtakes NOT_or NOT_new NOT_musical NOT_numbers , NOT_no NOT_jabba NOT_the NOT_hutt NOT_cameos . And it 's a testament to \" grease \" 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it 's the same all - around blast it 's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music . To ' 90s viewers , \" grease \" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo - wop and poodle skirts . But regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , \" grease \" is still the word .", "I love this book ! It is a terrific blend of hand - holding and concrete advice for writers . Each chapter takes the writer / reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write : How do we begin ? Where do ideas come from ? Is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin ? I like the fact that I could use this book as a resource . In other words , I did not NOT_have NOT_to NOT_read NOT_it NOT_cover NOT_to NOT_cover . Rather , it truly serves as a guide , a mentor 's guide , that can serve me as I continue to write . I really liked the movie section ,   where Cathleen Rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process .   I found those sections inspirational and useful . If you want to be a writer or if you are already writing , I urge you to Buy this book", "DeYoung begins by relating how Bush pushed Powell out at the end of his 1st term , NOT_without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him ; making matters worse was the   fact that Bush did n't NOT_even NOT_know why Powell was at the White House when it came time to say \" Good Bye . \"Colin Powell came from Jamaican parents ( often called \" Jewmaicans \" by American Negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education ) , and during his early life in the NYC area suffered little , if any , racial prejudice .   Later on , unfortunately , the insults were quite aggravating , but Powell was determined to not NOT_let NOT_them NOT_inhibit his performance . Powell was an indifferent student in high school and at CCNY ( majored in geology ) ; however , ROTC piqued his sophomore - year interest and he soon became a standout .   Powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet , and top graduate ( or very close ) in every military training setting he undertook , as well as a top MBA student at George Washington University .   He also was top - ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment , leading to his being offered a White House fellowship , which in turn provided Powell with travel to Russia and China and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward Powell onto Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , National Security Advisor , and Secretary of State . One of Powell 's \" secrets of success \" was to enthusiastically implement all orders , even those he considered silly - Powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others . Unfortunately , Powell eventually crossed paths with Dick Cheney ( a bit of a problem during Gulf War I ; a serious problem when Cheney became V.P. ) .   Between Cheney 's far - right bias ( \" out on the looney fringe \" - per Powell ) and Bush II 's \" disturbingly disjointed \" decision - making - per Treasury Secretary O'Neill ) , Powell 's contributions as Secretary of State were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded - often with Don Rumsfeld 's help .   In addition , he was often left out of important decisions , especially when out of the country .   Ultimately , Powell 's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his U.N. speech attesting to Saddam 's WMD.The big question , still debated , is \" Why did n't NOT_he NOT_resign ? \"   His supporters believe the reason is that Powell 's nature simply did n't NOT_allow NOT_anything NOT_less NOT_than NOT_100 % NOT_support . Bottom Line :   If Cheney had not NOT_been NOT_such NOT_an NOT_ideologue ( NOT_telling Bush there were no NOT_candidates NOT_good enough to run as his V.P. - ignoring Powell , and then sliding into the position himself ) , Powell would be V.P. today , possibly President in 2008 .   Similarly , if Bush # 41 had not NOT_been NOT_so NOT_stubborn and instead replaced Quayle with Powell in ' 92 , Powell might well have become first V.P. , and then President", "Home in Rome - for a weekend .

Thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman . Fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore . With the benefit of the first - hand recollections of that old ex - pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life . But \" when we were kings \" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match . Questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary . Gast could hardly NOT_choose NOT_otherwise , NOT_considering NOT_the NOT_vocal , NOT_uncompromising NOT_politics NOT_of NOT_muhammad NOT_ali . A member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast 's film with a forceful swipe at the united states . When ali hollers \" damn america ' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_ali NOT_is NOT_speaking his mind . His decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : \" no NOT_viet NOT_cong ever called me nigger \" , ali reasons . Despite showcasing ali 's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of \" when we were kings \" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion . Listening to the film 's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this \" rumble in the jungle \" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map . Spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a \" coming home \" to africa . Foreman reminds us that africa is the \" cradle of civilisation \" . Fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality . It is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator . While ali respects mobutu 's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well - stocked torture chambers . Mailer 's insights are lost on most of the film 's commentators . George plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire . With admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire ' s squalid ruling elite . Mobutu is not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_dubious NOT_character NOT_to NOT_benefit NOT_from NOT_the NOT_heady NOT_symbolism NOT_of NOT_black NOT_power . Don king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the \" messiah \" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity . Understandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal . He may be , as one sympathiser notes , \" blacker \" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king . Africa , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity . Little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali 's opponent was n't NOT_white . Admittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored . The audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time . There is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified . The excitement of james brown and b. b king in concert , for instance . And of course there 's always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - \" we gon na get it on coz we do n't NOT_get NOT_along ! \" . Doubtlessly , considering the multi - faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of \" when we were kings \" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention . Fortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event .", "This book rocks !

It 's just an interesting book , it does nt get much simpler than that", "It would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the Mahler Eighth ever recorded ; I believe it is . But it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something , because after experiencing this colossal achievement , the competition ( including , alphabetically , Abbado , Bernstein , Chailly , Haitink , Horenstein , Kubelik , Nagano , Olson [ Colorado Mahlerfest ] , Solti , and Tennstedt , among others ) suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had . What sets this Mahler Eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy ; of a transcendent vision being communicated , of a religious fervor . Mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work , such that he could bring us to the brink and say , \" There . It 's out there . You ca n't NOT_see NOT_it , but you can divine it \" ( and call \" it \" what you will : \" God \" or \" Love \" or some all - embracing power outside of ourselves ) . Most performances miss the mark , then , in one of two ways : by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand . The problem , of course , is that if we can understand it , it 's no NOT_longer a vision , it 's something mundane . In the closing pages of Wit 's extraordinary ( and that word , as well as any other , hardly NOT_begins NOT_to NOT_do it justice ) performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension . You know it 's there only because you 're willing to take that leap of faith . And that 's what I mean when I say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor . There is nothing NOT_dogmatic NOT_about NOT_the NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_religion NOT_I NOT_'m NOT_referring NOT_to NOT_here . So let 's look at the basic components of the performance , element by element : The sound : Spectacularly natural and all - encompassing . The soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra , and the chorus , orchestra , and organ blend to perfection . The soloists : To a letter the finest group I have ever heard . There 's a distinctly Slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given Mahler 's Bohemian roots , and a refreshing lack of self - importance . No NOT_operatic grandstanding here . And for the first time ever I felt as though I was missing something by not NOT_following NOT_the NOT_words ( no NOT_libretto is provided , though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere ) because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing . They were n't NOT_going NOT_through NOT_the NOT_motions , NOT_making NOT_pretty NOT_sounds . They had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it . To be honest , part II has often bored me to tears ( with Chailly 's performance being particularly offensive in this regard ) but here I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout , impatient to hear what ( and who ) came next . And throughout it all , so importantly , there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end . The choruses : Easily the best I 've ever heard . The way they rip into \" Hostem repellas longius \" with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part I is unforgettable , and the fugue itself , which has never reminded me more of the \" rabble \" section from the first movement of Mahler 's Third , literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course . That 's nothing . I got chills right at the beginning of the Chorus Mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not NOT_abated ! I have NEVER experienced anything like that before . Ever . And I do n't NOT_just NOT_mean NOT_while NOT_listening NOT_to NOT_music . The conductor : What can I say ? He holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before . How ? I have no NOT_idea , but when the start of part II does n't NOT_jar , NOT_as NOT_it NOT_usually NOT_does , you know you 're in for something special . Maybe it 's because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual , or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part ( the first entry of the soloists , for instance , is so raptly caressing).The orchestra : While they do n't NOT_have NOT_the \" NOT_Mahler NOT_sound \" that the Concertgebouw or Vienna Philharmonic may produce , there 's an earthiness ( but never sloppiness ) that sets them far apart from the bleached , sterile sound of too many American orchestras that make Mahler sound not NOT_like Mahler . To sum up , then , I could not NOT_speak NOT_for NOT_an NOT_hour NOT_after NOT_hearing NOT_this NOT_recording , NOT_and NOT_still NOT_burst NOT_into NOT_tears NOT_at NOT_the NOT_mere NOT_thought NOT_of NOT_it , NOT_especially NOT_those NOT_radiant , NOT_visionary , NOT_and NOT_extraordinary NOT_closing NOT_pages .

I 've been into Scarling for a few years now , and when I heard their first record,\"Sweet Heart Dealer \" , I instantly fell in love . I somewhat held it above everything else , I was so impressed by it . So when I heard the progression from SHD to SLS , I was a little bit let down .    But after three solid listens , from first to last , I was totally amazed by this record . It was like something clicked and I was able to see the beauty each track held .

He also recommended getting his Road To Hell cd . Both of these cd 's were money well spent . I 'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80 's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity , mainly due to his top 20 hit \" Fool ( If You Think It 's Over ) \" . For some reason I never equated that song with this artist . The thing I like most about Rea is his musical diversity . He can lay down a very memorable AM pop hit like \" Fool \" or \" Let 's Dance \" and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like \" Road To Hell \" . No NOT_matter NOT_what the genre of music , this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove . There 's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd . \" Auberge \" and especially the wonderful \" On The Beach \" stuck out for me . But you get many styles here . And each song sets a different mood . From the easy listening \" Winter Song \" or the catchy \" Looking For Summer \" . Or some excellent blues rock like \" Road To Hell \" , \" God 's Great Banana Skin \" or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off Rea 's tasty slide guitar skills . I do n't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_I NOT_missed NOT_this NOT_artist NOT_after NOT_all NOT_of NOT_these NOT_years . But I 'm a new Rea fan who now looks forward to his next album . Whatever style that it might be , I 'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb Best Of . This is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist . If your like me , after hearing this cd you 'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums . I 've since picked up his late 80 's album \" Dancing With Strangers \" . Another very nice cd . Most of the music on this Best Of cd is almost 20 years old , but it feels like it could have been written today . In other words it 's well composed music that holds up very well over time . And I 'm sure if your like me and not NOT_familiar NOT_with Rea 's music , the minute you hear \" Fool \" or \" On The Beach \" it 's going to bring the good part of the 80 's back to you .

What it is what the spice girls are all about : fun , songs , and a lot of \" girl power ! \" Drawing from a number of different films ( like the beatles ' \" hard day 's night \" ) \" spice world \" chronicles the week heading up to the girls ' first concert at london 's albert hall . ? they get to tool around london in a big ol' bus ( driven by meat loaf ! ) and generally have fun . ? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film , there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries , better known to americans , for about 15 minutes , as dame edna ( remember her ? ) ? he wants to sabotage the girls ' concert so he can sell papers . Of course , the point in a movie like \" spice world \" is n't NOT_plot . ? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves : ginger ( the recently departed geri haliwell ) , posh ( victoria adams ) , sporty ( melanie chisolm ) , scary ( melanie brown ) , and baby ( emma bunton ) . ? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest - to - goodness fun , something that ca n't NOT_be NOT_said NOT_for NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_people NOT_in NOT_films NOT_today .

Gregson - Williams does an outstanding job here ( before this , I was most familiar with his score work on Metal Gear Solid videogames ) .   The music is extremely touching and magical .   The \" Evacuating London Score \" ( from the scene in the train station ) tugs at the heartstrings .   And the \" Battle Score \" brings back the images of the dynamic battle at the movie 's climax .   One song that 's missing is the 1940s jazz song played in the movie when the kids are playing hide and seek .   Other than that absence ( probably due to copyright restrictions ) , this is an excellent CD .   As for the \" Bonus \" DVD - I probably would n't NOT_purchase NOT_it NOT_if NOT_I NOT_had NOT_a NOT_second NOT_chance .   It 's got some nice gallery art of movie stills and concept art .   There is only one trailer , and it is not NOT_the NOT_very NOT_first NOT_one NOT_released , NOT_which NOT_opens NOT_with NOT_the NOT_kids NOT_at NOT_the NOT_mansion NOT_and NOT_really NOT_gets NOT_the NOT_blood NOT_pumpin ' NOT_with NOT_its NOT_intro NOT_of NOT_the NOT_wardrobe .

Involved in these tests is hank marshall ( jones ) , an army colonel who is critical of the above - ground tests that are being done . He urges below - ground tests which no NOT_one will consider at the time until it is learned that the soviets have conducted underground tests of their own . Marshall is also troubled by a turbulent marriage to carly ( lange ) who is topless on the base 's beach in full view of the entire personnel . Hank 's reaction is one of amusement . He 's been here before and he deals with it in the only way he knows how . The problem is carly is a manic - depressive and when she is n't NOT_flirting NOT_with any man who happens to be near her , she 's fantasizing about a fictious world where she 'd rather be . Typical of the mental illness , she also is promiscuous and foul - tempered . The mood swings are quick and violent and the torment she puts her husband and their two daughters is considerable . From hank 's reports which state his opposition to the army 's methods of testing , he is transferred from hawaii to alabama . Carly patterns herself after movie stars and tries to become marilyn monroe , bleach - blond and all . The new home in alabama is pretty run - down and depressing and sets carly off on a violent tantrum . After meeting his new commanding officer ( booth ) , hank sees an all too familiar pattern begin to repeat . Carly openly flirts with the co. hank tries to deal with the situation , but his only resort is to carry her off and throw her into a nearby pool . Arguments ensue . The family becomes even more alienated . The co is very interested in pursuing an encounter with carly and sends hank off to observe an underground test which causes the irradiation of two local ranchers , much to the vocal objections of hank , who spots them but is unable to cancel the detonation of the bomb . Back at home , the two girls try to hold things together but they wonder why their father ca n't NOT_deal with their mother 's problems . One daughter says , \" he 's blind and she 's crazy . \" The other answers , \" they 're perfect for each other . \" It reaches the breaking point when the older girl ( locane ) and a boy , the co 's son ( o'donnell ) see her mother and the co making love in an abandoned shed . She forces her mother to tell hank and get it all out into the open . Hank returns home and finds his wife in the middle of a musical put on by the military wives , including the co 's wife ( snodgress ) . He confronts the c. o. But not NOT_about carly . He is upset over the coverup surrounding the accident during the testing . A fight breaks out between the two when the co accuses hank of not NOT_being NOT_able to satisfy his wife . Hank is arrested . What follows is manipulation and revenge on the part of the co. he convinces carly to commit hank to a hospital for observation . Instead , they fill him with so many drugs that he can barely NOT_cope . He foams at the mouth and can not NOT_even NOT_finish sewing a leather wallet as presents for his daughters . Carly is determined to free her husband from the clutches of the army and succeeds in doing so only by being the strong one in the family for the first time . The film has an upbeat ending with hope that the family has found a way to deal with its problems . The performances are solid throughout . Jones is sympathetic and loving and is most effective in those quiet moments when he tries to deal with his wife 's rage . He comforts her and offers protection . Lange gives a strong and spirited portrayal of a woman on the edge who draws up the courage to try and put things right for her family . Amy locane is very good as she fights to keep her family together while struggling with her own doubts as to whether she even should . Blue sky is based on the story of the stagner family . The screenplay was written by rama laurie stagner ( with arlene sarner and jerry leichtling ) . The film marks the final work of tony richardson who died shortly after its completion in 1991 . He had made such classics as look back in anger ( 1958 ) and tom jones ( 1963 ) . Orion pictures underwent bankruptcy and caused the film to sit on a shelf for three years . The film joins an alread promising fall line - up of films and is well worth catching for the performances alone .", "Film adaptation of hunter s. thompson 's infamous semi - autobiographical hallucinogen - fueled book of the same title . Director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) ) \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . Plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . During their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy - five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half - full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi - colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . The movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . Critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer 's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . If you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . If , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not NOT_imagine NOT_you NOT_truly NOT_appreciating much of this drug - induced picture 's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) . Note : i have not NOT_read NOT_thompson NOT_'s NOT_book . Having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol - based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . This movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . It moves admirably from one scene to the next , without NOT_much NOT_basis NOT_of NOT_their NOT_being , NOT_while NOT_presenting NOT_us NOT_with NOT_the NOT_two NOT_days NOT_in NOT_the NOT_life NOT_of NOT_writer NOT_hunter NOT_s. NOT_thompson NOT_during NOT_which NOT_he NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_consume NOT_more NOT_drugs NOT_and NOT_alcohol NOT_than NOT_anyone NOT_could NOT_ever NOT_imagine . It was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a ' changing \" in the states . Johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . During the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real - life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . I thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . The one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . I could n't NOT_believe NOT_that NOT_this NOT_fat , NOT_samoan NOT_lawyer , NOT_was NOT_the NOT_same NOT_guy NOT_who NOT_played NOT_the NOT_slick NOT_mumbling NOT_criminal NOT_in NOT_the NOT_usual NOT_suspects ( NOT_7 . NOT_5/10 ) . Word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . Plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . Other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not NOT_as NOT_wild NOT_as NOT_i NOT_thought NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be , and the ending was certainly not NOT_much NOT_of a barn - burner , but then again , who really noticed . This movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug - ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . And for all those who plan on seeing this movie NOT_without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . Little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . Bill murray also portrayed a thompson - based character in the film where the buffalo roam . Johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what 's eating gilbert grape ? ( 7/10 ) . In 1988 , depp told rolling stone magazine that he 'd tried every drug by the age of 14 . Johnny hung out with some of the members of oasis while filming the uncompleted divine rapture in ireland , and later played some slide guitar on the 1997 album , be here now . Johnny was born in kentucky , is a high - school dropout , has nicknamed himself \" mr . stench \" , has been engaged to four women until now ( including actress winona ryder , whose \" winona forever \" tattoo had to be altered to \" wino forever \" after their breakup ) , currently plays guitar in a band called \" p \" , and owns the viper room nightclub in l. a.", "Great little hideaway .

It dies today rip off the former bands style , but they are still a very good band .   In the over - crowded metalcore market of today , that is a rarity .

Favorite songs : \" The Radiance , \" \" Freak Gasoline Fight , \" \" Our Disintigration , \" and : THe Caitliff Choir : Defeatism", "Darren Aronofsky 's movies are beautiful masterpieces . From \" Pi \" to \" The Fountain \" , going through \" Requiem For a Dream \" , they will forever stand as timeless jewels . So they are hard to top in any way , but Clint Mansell has been able to do it every single time , scoring each of them . For \" The Fountain \" , he teamed up once more with Kronos Quartet and had Scottish post - rock band Mogwai join in too , to produce a score that fits the movie like a glove , in a very organic way . The central theme to the movie is instrumented in a way that works fantastically well across all the time periods the movie encompasses . The combination of the talents of Mansell , the Quartet and Mogwai yields a relatively dark , yet breathtaking musical piece that will stand the test of time much like the movie it was meant to score", "Magnifico .   I ca nt fault this place at all We stayed for four nights in a Deluxe room . It was everything that you would expect from this type of establishment The room w as furnished in a. country house . style . The marble bathroom was large . The decor was in reasonable condition We only ate in the Doney restaurant at breakfast time . there were always plenty of staff on hand to ensure things were running smoothly . and a decent spread was put on The door staff were always helpful in calling a cab for you or carrying your cases - even to the point where when one of them saw us taking our own cases towards the reception to check out he sprinted half way across the hotel to take the cases away from us The location is OK but it is about a 30 minute walk to the Colosseum and roughly the same to the Vatican I would look beyond Via Veneto for eating and drinking though since we were not NOT_particularly NOT_impressed NOT_by what you get for the money . at the hotel or the nearby restaurants There is a cool looking bar on the end of the Doney restaurant . and actually part of the hotel . but expect to pay 11 euro for a beer . 13 euro for a cocktail . which is not NOT_actually NOT_outrageous NOT_for NOT_a NOT_European NOT_capital . and at 95 euro for a bottle of Verve Cliquot this is 20 euro more than ordering it from room service .", "Cool Rooms at Bailey 's . Bailey 's Hotel ticked allmost all the boxes for my husband and I. The room was very quiet . clean and cool and the staff came twice a day to replentish toiletries . On the minus side it was very dark and due to being a side room overlooking an internal courtyard we never saw daylight .

The latest discoveries are listed which makes it a solid addition to the book & quot;The Bible as History.&quot", "In many ways , this album is everything one would have expected-- somehow the natural successor to \" No NOT_Pussyfooting \" and \" Evening Star \" .   In other ways , its nothing NOT_like NOT_I NOT_would NOT_have NOT_expected-- NOT_the NOT_usual NOT_stamps NOT_of NOT_Fripp NOT_and NOT_Eno NOT_'s NOT_recent NOT_work NOT_seems to be missing . Its really quite hard to largely identify the identity of the musician generating the sound on much of this material , there 's obvious stuff ( we 'll come to that in a minute ) , but as a rule , the backgrounds could be either of them .   Sonically , it moves through a number of backdrops , with delicate , percussive , synthish loops dominating the early part of the record ( \" Meissa \" , \" Lyra \" , \" Tarazed \" ) , wheras the middle of the record feels more like their old collaborations updated , the sort of modern Fripp soundscapes being more apparent ( \" Lupus \" , \" Ankaa \" ) .   The remainder of the album features on track that is totally unexpected , the downright funky \" Altair \" , with its train shuffling rhythms , drum loops , and funky guitar ( in ways similar to material from the Eno / Schwaum \" Drawn from Life \" record ) , and the closer , \" Terebellum \" , is an aggressive , haunting , and almost angry sounding piece almost reminiscent of \" Radiophonics \" or the other more aggressive soundscapes . Over this material , Fripp largely solos using a variant of his legendary fuzz tone-- its a bit mellower , and rounder though , similar to his leads on \" Starless \" and \" The Power to Believe Part II \" but in a more hushed feel . So that tells not NOT_much , the real question is , what 's it like ?   Largely an ambient affair , the collaboration is what you 'd expect-- there 's no NOT_real NOT_incindiery moments here-- do n't NOT_look NOT_for a \" Baby 's On Fire \" , but it is comparable to their previous collaborations in quality , and it certainly sounds NOT_nothing like Crimson .   Some of it is full of delicate beauty ( \" Lyra \" ) , some of its just a blast ( \" Altair \" ) , some of its actually quite hard to listen to at all ( \" Terebellum\").For fans of ambient music , especially the work of these two gentelemen , this one will be quite rewarding .   It falls short somehow of being a masterpiece , but it is really a great record .

De Wall does protest too much -- he 's clearly answering his critics throughout -- but I found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing .

Probably a little more difficult to get into than Streethawk , but after about the 4th or 5th listen , I found it more rewarding .   The music is very dense , and the lyrics are beautifully poetic ( it helps that Dan Bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time ) .

Wilson 's , Adrenal Fatigue , The 21st Century Stress Syndrome", "The music contained Trout Mask Replica is some of the most unique , acid - drenched art to ever be pressed . The songs on the album are mainly divided into folkish a capella tunes and the crazed jams the Captain and his band are known for . Several strange , unconventional themes are visited and revisted throughout the track list , such as bulbs , gingham , trout , and a variety of other surreal , sensously described wildlife . However , if there 's any reason to buy Captain Beefheart 's Trout Mask Replica , it 's to listen to the album as a whole . I find it difficult to listen to any other way .

At nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film . It not NOT_only NOT_demands NOT_your NOT_attention , NOT_but NOT_challenges NOT_you NOT_to NOT_grasp NOT_the NOT_significance NOT_of NOT_seemingly NOT_unrelated NOT_storylines NOT_and NOT_hidden NOT_intentions . It is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking . It 's also a movie that will polarize its viewers . Director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song does n't NOT_let NOT_up NOT_until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo - climax . The character 's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives . There is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose \" search and destroy \" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants . There is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son . There is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public . And there is police officer jim kurring ( john c. reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process . Given equal weight are stories involving a coke - addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h. macy ) . A materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) . Hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair . It is not NOT_a NOT_pleasant NOT_movie . There is not NOT_one NOT_bad NOT_note NOT_in NOT_the NOT_acting . It is affecting and layered and wonderful . There is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films . Then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene . Walters plays her character with red - eyed rawness and a fierce self - destructiveness that is anxiety inducing . Robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion 's roar when he speaks . Director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote . The problem is that he stays on them too long . Julianne moore 's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it . After a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture . Quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off - putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around . And just what is the theme ? Alienation ? Hopelessness ? Anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he does n't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_easy . The film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events . It 's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come . At times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time . Other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening . Anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film ! What 's surprising is that it mostly works . If you have doubts about anderson 's intentions , i 'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame . Despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man 's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption . Despite magnolia 's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts . This is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling . My rating : a bulleye . ( stars ) A side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann . Her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful . When she sings \" save me \" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as \" wise up \" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives .", "With his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no NOT_different . Its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . The parallels do n't NOT_end NOT_there , NOT_either . Atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big - screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king 's dreamcatcher . Even the film 's content is a bit reminiscent of mile . In fact , it 's the perfect blend of the feel - good ' 60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . King 's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film 's title comes from the second chapter ) . It 's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year - old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self - centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould 's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . Bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . When a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby 's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . Ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . I wo n't NOT_go NOT_into NOT_what NOT_these NOT_powers NOT_are , but they 're considerably toned down from the book ( and do n't NOT_involve NOT_black NOT_stuff NOT_flying NOT_out NOT_of NOT_ted NOT_'s NOT_mouth , NOT_a NOT_la NOT_mile ) . Atlantis ' present - day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel 's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle - aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . Atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks ' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar - nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski 's red . The acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . Most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . While i did n't NOT_really NOT_have NOT_much of a problem with goldman 's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . Goldman , for those of you who do n't NOT_read NOT_premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else 's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no NOT_sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he 's penned ( like the general 's daughter ) . It 's mean - spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o. j. And robert blake ) . In atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . Well , he 's not , and it does n't NOT_make NOT_sense . 1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements", "The grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80 's . More practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director 's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full - length feature film . Alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation . In his day bava was considered by most to be no NOT_great NOT_filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970 's . ( note that the film has no NOT_connection NOT_with the 1975 exorcist - rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . ) This story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco . The film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband 's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier . They hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on . To reveal any more of the story would be unfair . Suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english . Bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento . Her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora 's troubled soul . The music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd - sounding 70 's rock with classic gothic piano sequences . And there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair . Yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal . Lamberto bava and francesco barbieri 's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap . Scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .", "The story is about Peter growing up with his family in North Dublin and is set in the 1960 's . The tightly knit family relations with his own family and those of his extended family of lodgers , which his parents took in to supplement   his father 's income , forms the backdrop to his story at 44 Seville Place . The pace of the book has the rhythm of the sixties . The short sentences beat out the rhythm of the sixties and keeps the tempo up - beat throughout the whole of the book . For those who have experienced Dublin in the sixties this book will take you back to that place and that time . The metaphorical pieces were very touching and masterfully executed . One example of this technique was when Peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother Frankie before Frankie goes into surgery . A joy to read . Da is the Sun and all the minor planets revolve around him . Peter takes to his role as Mercury the messenger with great relish . There is a strong bond between father and son .   I feel this story should not NOT_be NOT_compared NOT_to Frank McCourt 's Angela 's Ashes . A one generation step into the future in Ireland can make a very big difference in how life is experienced . It was   a very enjoyable read whereby the need to laugh out loud in places could not NOT_be NOT_silenced . However there were places in the book where the need to cry out loud could also not NOT_be NOT_silenced .", "gorgeous hotel .   we stayed here last summer . it was wonderful . the bathrooms were totally gorgeous . a nice breakfast was included . but since i need some time to aclimate to the new day . i just ordered coffee and a roll from room service -- and they gave us a break on the room service when we checked out . it is very close to the borghese gallery . and there 's a nice place for coffee just across the street . the hard rock cafe is just down the street if you need a cheeseburger fix . we are going back this summer and will stay at the excelsior again .", "The muppet movie is the first , and the best movie among the ever - growing list of muppet movies . The muppet movie tells the story of how our hero , kermit the frog , came to be a star . A delightful movie for all ages , the muppet movie is * bursting * with cameo appearances by countless hollywood stars of the 80 's and today . The muppet movie begins in a movie theater , where all of the muppet stars are anxiously awaiting the first showing . Once everyone is settled down , the movie inside of the movie begins . It starts out with kermit in a swamp , playing his banjo and singing ( this shot required jim henson to spend hours underwater ) . Kermit is discovered by bernie , a big - time hollywood agent who happens upon kermit by accident . Bernie believes that kermit holds much potential to become a big star in hollywood . Kermit ponders the idea of becoming a big movie star , where he could \" make millions of people happy \" . Kermit decides to leave his swamp and make the trip out to hollywood . Along the way , kermit befriends his now famous muppet companions , beginning with fozzie bear , who had been spending his days doing stand - up comedy at the el sleezo cafe , owned by james coburn . The two decide to team - up and continue on their way to hollywood . But , doc hopper ( charles durning ) , the owner of a chain of french fried frog leg restaurants has a different idea . He wants kermit to be his spokesman , but kermit is humiliated at the idea and spends the movie avoiding him and his assistants . The trip continues , with kermit and fozzie meeting miss piggy , rowlf , gonzo , the electric mayhem band , and more muppets who all share the same wish : to make it to hollywood . Oh , and even more celebrities continue to appear . Kermit and miss piggy continue to get to know each other a little better , including a rather funny scene at a restaurant with steve martin as the waiter . Eventually , kermit and the group make it to hollywood . That is , after kermit is finally able to elude doc hopper and proclaim his freedom . Lord lew , a big - time hollywood producer portrayed by orson welles , gives kermit his shot at stardom and gives him the go - ahead to produce a movie . The muppet movie is definitely a movie that is fun for all ages . It is also a sure - deal as one parents can watch , and enjoy along with their kids .", "The farrelly brothers ' third film , after dumb and dumber ( 7 . 5/10 ) and kingpin ( 8/10 ) , brings together the real - life couple of cameron diaz and matt dillon , some nasty humour , a cute dog , and a mix of love , fate and romance . Plot : high - school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl in his class asks him to the prom . Unfortunately for ted , he accidentally gets a part of his male anatomy ( ouch ! ) Caught in his zipper , and misses the big night . Thirteen years later , ted still ca n't NOT_get NOT_mary NOT_out NOT_of NOT_his NOT_mind , NOT_and NOT_hires NOT_a NOT_private NOT_detective ( NOT_dillon ) NOT_to NOT_find NOT_her . Once found , it turns out that mary has more than one suitor , and that 's when the real fun begins . Critique : likeable comedy with a few extremely funny scenes , some funny looking people , and a plot that wo n't NOT_ever NOT_put NOT_you NOT_to sleep . Having said that , i must admit that i did like the farrellys ' two previous films more than this one , but that is saying a lot , since i really did love those earlier pics . This one is also quite funny , but it did n't NOT_really NOT_blow NOT_me NOT_away NOT_like NOT_the NOT_others . Then again , maybe my expectations were too high . Then again , maybe i should shut up , and write a little more about the film , and less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking / disliking the film . Continuing where their other pictures left off , the farrellys ' create a cutesy world of people with strange and endearing qualities , and a simple plot by which to tie them all together . This one also includes plenty of toilet humour , but also some borderline fun - making of the disabled and mentally - challenged . I must admit that i really was n't NOT_sure NOT_whether NOT_to NOT_laugh at some points or NOT_not . Not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_place NOT_to NOT_be . Having said that , the scenes that did tear through the audience , and yours truly , were extremely hilarious , and went on for several minutes after the punchline . The laughter practically killed out the next scene for one of the best ones in the movie ( something to do with hair gel ) . On the negative end , i did not NOT_like NOT_the NOT_musical NOT_interludes NOT_of NOT_jonathan NOT_richman NOT_that NOT_ran NOT_through NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_picture . I found them quite useless , unfunny and distracting . Also , i found that a lot of the funnier scenes had already been shown in the film 's trailer . And of course , i never quite buy the fact that these beautiful , intelligent , single women still ca n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_find the \" right guy \" ( see kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) . I did really like all of the actors in the film , especially ben stiller , who appears to be solidifying his mark as a great comical actor with this picture and one of my favourites from 1996 , flirting with disaster ( 8/10 ) . I also liked matt dillon with his big teeth , and lee evans with his superb faux - sympathy british accent . Funny stuff . Also , make sure that you stay for the credits , because there is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip - synched version of \" build me up buttercup \" , which is really cool . Overall , a cute comedy with a decent premise , and a few particularly hilarious scenes . Little known facts : the farrellys big break came when they somehow got a copy of their script \" dust to dust \" into the hands of eddie murphy via ? murphy 's neighbour . They only found out about murphy 's interest , when they saw eddie mention the script on the david letterman show one night . Matt dillon is a high school dropout . In between acting gigs , dillon has branched out into the restaurant business . Close to home in his native new york , he co - owns both a bar called the whiskey and a swanky uptown eatery called the falls . Cameron diaz stands 5 \" 9 , started working as a model at the early age of 16 , and loves cats . Ben stiller 's father is jerry stiller . He played george costanza 's ( jason alexander ) father on tv 's \" seinfeld \" . Peter farrelly has written a novel entitled \" outside providence \" which is currently being filmed starring alec baldwin . Rob moran , who plays the cop in this film , also played the millionaire bowler in kingpin , and the bartender in dumb and dumber . He is old friends with the farrelly brothers from college , and is currently married to entertainment tonight anchor / correspondant julie moran . Harland williams , who plays the nutty hitchhiker in this film , also played a state trooper in the farrelly 's earlier dumb and dumber , and was the star of the unfortunate rocket man .", "Absolutely Awesome .

The film , which cost $ 200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it ' sunk ' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . We all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . But sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron 's best films ) The film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . They find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . The woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . The explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . In the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . Also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . She nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . Oh yeah , and the ship sinks . And that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . The story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . The story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck - up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in - jokes of how the boat wo n't NOT_sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it 's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . Without NOT_good NOT_dialogue , NOT_a NOT_film NOT_could NOT_become NOT_a NOT_very NOT_long , NOT_very NOT_boring NOT_film ( NOT_like NOT_camerons NOT_own NOT_terminator NOT_2 , NOT_1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . Firstly , there 's cameron 's direction . There are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . But the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . There is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . It 's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . Thanks to cameron 's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . To support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . Dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16 - 17 years old . His performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . Winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . Zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . The audience really does come to hate him . He may be playing the same character he plays in every film he 's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . Also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . Finally , the icing on the ' great things ' cake are the special effects . Cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . The sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , can not NOT_animate NOT_human NOT_movement NOT_too NOT_well . The humans seem to move to ' smoothly ' , there 's just something odd about them . You can tell that they have been animated on a computer . Of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . Titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . Titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not NOT_writing and story . Again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . Titanic , then , although not NOT_the NOT_godfather NOT_of NOT_movies NOT_it NOT_could NOT_of NOT_been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . Enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound .

Not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_an NOT_expensive NOT_one . ) Sometimes a movie even combines them all into a big , sprawling motion picture event , as did forrest gump four years ago . With action films , it was aliens , whic was released to much hype seven years after it 's equally - innovative parent , alien ( 1979 ) . Directed and written by james cameron ( t2 : judgement day , the abyss , true lies ) , the authority on action films , it was a masterful encore to his sci - fi thriller the terminator ( 1984 ) . While the original alien film was a dark , enclosed horror film that featured one alien slowly massacering a horrified crew , james cameron took the big - budget action film with aliens , which featured multiple aliens doing basically the same thing , although on a much - larger scale . And boy , did he take that route ! I 'd say at about 165 mph or so ... The film opens 57 years after the original , with lt . ripley ( weaver ) being found in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel . If you 'll recall , at the end of alien ripley , the only surviving member , cryogenically \" hibernated \" herself after expelling the rogue alien from her ship . Unfortunately , she thought she 'd only be out for a couple of weeks ... Once she 's returned to earth , ripley is quickly interrogated by \" the company \" , who quickly dismiss her and her stories as lunacy . In truth , they believe her , as they soon approach ripley with an offer to travel with some marines to a new colony planet as an \" alien advisor \" . It seems that the colony planet was a once - breeding ground for the nasty aliens , and now all communication with the planet has been lost ... It does n't NOT_exactly NOT_take NOT_a NOT_genius NOT_to NOT_guess NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_next : NOT_ripley NOT_agrees , and before you can say \" big mistake \" , she and the half dozen marines , plus the slimy corporate guy ( reiser ) , who has more than it looks like up under his sleeve , are off to the colony . When they arrive , they find the planet in ruins . Only one survivor is found , a little girl , newt , who confirms that , yes , the aliens were here and that she only managed to survive by hidding in the ventilation system . And soon enough , the marines come under attack from the aliens ... What happens for the next hour and a half or so is what completely sets this movie apart from any other standard alien sci - fi movie : the action scenes . Cameron directs them so skillfully , and so suspensefully , that you 're literally ringing your hands by the time the finale rolls around . Which features , in my opinion , the best fight scene ever recorded on film , as ripley straps herself into a huge robot and battles the nasty queen alien to the death . Many people will tell you that this film , while being a great action film , has no NOT_real NOT_drama and is all cliches . Well , they would be wrong , my friends . If this film had no \" NOT_drama \" , then why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at the 1987 academy awards ? That 's right , best actress . You know that any action film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing and f / x has got to be good . In short , aliens combines all the right elements ( great action and f / x , drama , a good plot , good dialogue , and great villains ) into what could arguably be called the best action film of all time . Then again , maybe not . Movies rise and fall from glory and , sad to say , aliens was wrestled from it 's throne of best action movie by another cameron film , t2 : judgement day , in 1991 . So who will be the next king ? Well , let 's wait until december 19th and see yet another james cameron film - the highest budgeted film of all time - titanic to make that decision .

(ALL WOMEN ARE EQUAL , IN MY EYES .... Nigel .. )In this remarkable novel , SK makes his debut . An unlikely but good book . It has a good dose of horror / suspense and it is one of the best books I have ever read ... It is simply about a teenager from Maine , named Carietta White(Carrie).From the beginning of the story we see who her mother(Margaret white)takes advantage of her , making her feel stupid and left out . Similiarly in school , Carrie is always the \" Black sheep\",she has not NOT_friends and she is always picked upon . She is very unusual and strange , at least to most people , especially the ones in the book(story).(but I would say quite frankly that I did n't NOT_see NOT_here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl.)At the beginning of the story we also see that Carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school . She is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her . This is her first big humiliation.(I am a guy , I know not NOT_much about a period , so please forgive my use of the term openly)Anyway , back to the plot : Carrie soon realizes that she is Psychic . She starts to practice using her powers gradually . It seems as though she had the powers since birth , but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it . So , so far we see this : a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother . The story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end . Allow me ..... It is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic . Carrie 's mother explains alot of things , but she is still a bad mother.(but I still ca n't NOT_hate NOT_carries NOT_'s NOT_mother , NOT_because NOT_most NOT_mothers NOT_are sort of protective over their children)Soon Carrie gets her first friend Sue . Sue feels sorry for Carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom . This date is Tommy Ross ... Meanwhile , one of the bad girls , Chris , is unable to attend the prom . So , she sets up a nasty revenge against Carrie . Believe me when I tell you , Chris is a very jealous girl and if she ca n't NOT_have NOT_something , NOT_no NOT_one NOT_else NOT_can , especially Carrie . So Chris arranges a trap for Carrie.(Two buckets of pig blood)She sets it up for the pig blood to fall on Carrie 's and Tommy 's head while at the prom ... The plan eventually succeeds . Tommy is badly injured . Drenched in pig 's blood , Carrie is laughed at , for the last time . She runs out of the building . She then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge . She starts to close all the doors . She then turns on all the water sprinklers , wetting everyone . But with a combination of water and electricity(from the appliances) .... some were electrocuted . Eventually a fire gets started . And things start to burn!She walks toward her home , burning everything within a certain radius of her powers . When she reaches home her mother tries to kill her , telling her that she is the spawn of satan . She eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers ' heart beat , killing her . Eventually(this is the good part of the book),while Carrie is walking on the streets(going I do n't know where)she seens Chris and Chris 's boyfriend driving towards her , to bounce her . Carrie uses her powers to diverge to car , killing Chris and her stupid boyfriend . Sue eventually catches up with Carrie . Carrie does n't kill her because she realizes that it was n't Sue 's falt but Chris's.(During the battle with her mother , Carrie was stabbed , I forgot to mention it , sorry.)So , now , talking with sue Carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just , dies.(this is the sad part , I guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes , or maybe not)But this book is definitely good , I recommend it with all my \" Psychic \" powers . Enjoy ............. This review was written by Nigel ....", "Every year -- every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars \" sur - prise ! \" Into my bewildered visage . It 's almost always a surprise . It sure as niflheim was this time . Amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason . And , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_fairy NOT_tale , NOT_where NOT_we NOT_roll NOT_our NOT_eyes NOT_occasionally , NOT_smirk NOT_to NOT_ourselves , NOT_and NOT_maybe NOT_get NOT_a NOT_forced NOT_tear NOT_out NOT_of NOT_the NOT_eyes NOT_and NOT_a \" NOT_boy , NOT_i NOT_wish that could happen \" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash . Another e. t. Another short circuit . This film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time . America has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) . Amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it 's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze -- or , more importantly , sharp thought -- will shatter the wax facade of the panorama . This is a very sturdy scenario . The principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances -- always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role . The writer / producer , david field , seems to literally take all the \" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen \" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before ! Astounding ! He uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it ! I am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it 's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film . I do n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_give NOT_too NOT_much NOT_away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons . His decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , \" amazing \" grace smith , and , well , i 'm leaving it at that because i would n't NOT_spoil NOT_this NOT_film NOT_for NOT_you NOT_for the world . Let me just say this , though : i am not NOT_recommending NOT_this NOT_film NOT_because NOT_i NOT_think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply . I do n't NOT_give NOT_a NOT_rat NOT_'s NOT_ass NOT_for NOT_the NOT_political NOT_point - NOT_of - NOT_view NOT_this NOT_film NOT_expresses , NOT_one NOT_way or another ; i 'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it 's an excellent story , told with excellence . No , i do n't NOT_believe NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_could NOT_happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think . The point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen . This is the natural and more -- all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot . It carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood -- and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self - consciousness . Special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real - life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing 's manager and friend ; william l. peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l. a. ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is", "First Class . Just returned from a long weekend This hotel is well worth the time we spent reviewing sites . locations and hotels on the internet . This hotel is stiuated in a street comparable to Park lane in London and is convieniently placed for most of the popular attractions .

We also used it to book a hire car from Hertz . UK site . at a far cheaper rate than quoted at the Hertz Rome office . just round the corner .

( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . ) The story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive . A device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously . This is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it 's required destination . In this case , from near neptune to proxima prime . However , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without NOT_trace , NOT_leaving NOT_two NOT_searches NOT_for NOT_it NOT_fruitless . Seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts . A search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate . The team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive . As the team search the event horizon , they find no NOT_trace NOT_of NOT_the NOT_crew but plenty of blood lying around . Not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_sign ... To make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago . It soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it . Something very , very evil ... The first thing you 'll notice in this film is it 's incredible visual effects . They really are eye popping , with some great models to boot . The acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments . Sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no NOT_nonense NOT_manner . It is his acting skills that help hold this film together . The idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one . It starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur . However , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! ) Climaxes i 've recently witnessed . Overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed . It 's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals . But be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory . Not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_squemish !", "Great Place . This was a great place to stay . Clean . good basic buffet breakfast . with cappucino .   we walked to everything except the Vatican .

Good food on other side of train station on Amedeo .", "One of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy 's wedding . And she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it . Her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who has n't NOT_made NOT_a NOT_worthwhile NOT_film NOT_since 1986 . But the fact is , betsy 's wedding is also an alan alda film . And while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life . Written and directed by alda , betsy 's wedding is a vibrant slice - of - life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor . Alda 's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing -- and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare . As bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting . Walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob . Ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain . She looks hideous with her short - cropped orange hair , red lip - stick and grotesque outfits . She 's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown . And to make matters worse , ringwald 's performance matches her appearance . Thankfully , alda keeps ringwald 's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters . The wedding is just a device to bring together the bride 's working - class , italian family and the groom 's rich , gentile family . Ringwald 's folks are homey and down - to - earth , with alda as her free - spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister . Walsh 's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious . When the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , \" money versus values . \" Ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film 's most pleasant surprises . Sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body . It 's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight . Lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old - fashioned chivalry . Lapaglia 's sincere but dim - witted character is a riot . And what 's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure . Lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role - model and partly a rip - off . I do n't NOT_know NOT_whether NOT_to NOT_say NOT_a NOT_star NOT_is NOT_born NOT_or NOT_a NOT_star NOT_is NOT_re - NOT_born , but i do know that lapaglia 's over - the - top performance should not NOT_be NOT_missed . The scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia . Joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda 's unscrupulous brother - in - law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) . Alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride 's financially - strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet . The film adopts alda 's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it . As a filmmaker , alda 's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful . And while he does n't NOT_have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .", "Ministry Of Sound has always had the reputation of putting out the best music .

They are unaware of exactly what is going to happen . One man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck . As the flap falls , the battle begins . They are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire . Amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler 's list .

He bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not NOT_bothering NOT_to NOT_ask NOT_himself ; \" NOT_what now ? \" Saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film . The direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar . The cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding . But be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen . The articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get . The question is , \" does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? \" The answer from my point of view is \" no \" . Braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film . Ryan is ten times worse . Expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield . Many in the theater could not NOT_bear NOT_to NOT_watch . And it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year . But such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) . Saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d - day , 1944 , through into the film 's primary mission . Captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield . The government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan does n't NOT_recieve NOT_a NOT_fourth NOT_letter of condolences about her sons , that no NOT_person should suffer such injustice . Miller 's crew is not NOT_in NOT_favor NOT_of NOT_the NOT_mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they do n't NOT_yet NOT_know NOT_him . They resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who does n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_more NOT_or NOT_less NOT_right to live than any of them . This film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end . The pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it 's own . Spielberg , though not NOT_a NOT_student NOT_of NOT_the \" NOT_quick NOT_cut \" NOT_school NOT_of NOT_filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it . Bay should pay close attention , take copious notes . If you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan . In the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not NOT_justified NOT_by NOT_the \" NOT_importance \" NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . Schindler 's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust . It opened eyes , sparked debate and study . Though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they do n't NOT_amount NOT_to NOT_anything NOT_as NOT_serious NOT_or NOT_thought NOT_provoking NOT_as NOT_the NOT_schindler NOT_'s NOT_list . Overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , \" war is hell . \" But braveheart - dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again .

I will just give you my impression of this collection of work . No NOT_collection can ever really be complete , there are always new things to add , new commentary , newly discovered works , transcripts of records and unpublished letters , but this book does an excellent job in its attempt . To me Charles Bukowski will always be one of the greatest American writers of the twentieth century , because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates . It is funny , sad , sadistic , cruel , scathing , enlightening and thought provoking . Everything I like to read . This is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers , trees and Greek mythology . This is RAW human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper . It is not NOT_perfect , and it is not NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_be . It does n't NOT_always NOT_work , but there in lies the subtle beauty of Bukowski 's efforts . the guts to try . The attempts at honesty , clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything , and his cynicism of man . This book has one of the most moving , amazing , and insightful poems ... or anything else ... ever written .   It is called The Genius Of The Crowd .

It 's world war ii , and the russian - german standoff in town could determine the outcome of things for the motherland . Law 's vassili is the russian 's top pawn to victory . Lots of war stuff happens . An older , german version of jude 's character played by ed harris shows up halfway into the proceedings . He 's equally talented , and the two men play a cat and mouse game trying to kill each other . They constantly switch roles , as the war fades far into the background . The cast also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest for both vassili and danilov The set - up is decent , and so are the production values . Boasting a wide range of grimy locales , greasy hair , and tattered costumes , the art direction prospers . The actors , however , suffer the problem matt damon had in ` saving private ryan ' . Either their eyes , teeth , skin , or a combination of other features looked too white and clean . With dirt and blood all around , the blinding teeth or bright eyes of these actors divert attention from the action . That said , the players are mostly good in their roles , although i do n't NOT_think NOT_ed NOT_harris NOT_was NOT_really NOT_trying . Maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord in one - notedom . While the film is technically about snipers , there are far too many predictable sniping scenes . Director jean - jacques annaud expects us to view each tense situation with jude and some cohort in a tight spot as edgy and exciting , but after about the sixth time , in which we realize that jude is not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_die , it 's relatively pointless . We get that he 's talented , okay , let 's move on . That 's the problem with ` enemy at the gates ' ; it just does n't NOT_know NOT_when NOT_to NOT_stop .

We saw reviews about the rooms being small . but we were assigned a room that was almost a junior suite . with a balcony ask for room 134 .   Room is well equipped . has an honor bar refrig . Even though on top of busy street . room is well soundproofed . We went in late Feb. and got a rate of . 660USD all taxes . etc . plus breakfast . for 5 nights which was less than what it would have cost to go to Los Angeles . Right out the front of the hotel . are 2 bus stops both directions . that will take you almost anywhere in Rome . or where you can make a connection . Coming into Termini from Fiumicino . take the 175 bus to the Minghetti stop on del Corso- hotel across the street . Ca nt get any easier . If you are not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_market NOT_for NOT_a NOT_super NOT_expensive NOT_international NOT_hotel . this would be a great choice .", "This book provides fascinating details of what life was like for children in Colonial America : How they played , what their education was like , what they wore , etc . The information is drawn from such primary sources as letters , journals and school primers . There are a number of pictures as well . I recommend it", "This book covers all the elements of Game Theory , emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism .   The philosophical aspects are also given a thorough   treatment .     The 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition   of several key concepts such as the Minmax Theorem , the geometry of   equilibria and Linear programming .   The book has not NOT_changed NOT_much NOT_since NOT_its NOT_  NOT_publication NOT_in NOT_1957 , but it is by no NOT_means NOT_  NOT_archaic .       Even for those   who have a modern and more rigorous textbook ,   & quot;Games and   Decisions&quot ; is   Highly recommended   as a supplement . There is something   for everyone in it", "Wow ! what a movie . It 's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original . Yep that pretty much describes this movie . It starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen . It boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we can not NOT_get movies like this more often . Besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever . Period . Then again there are so many good movies , that one can not NOT_pick NOT_an NOT_all NOT_time NOT_favorite . John cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job . His wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un - noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of . Craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building ... you Have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 . He is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer . In his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden . To his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich 's mind . Fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike . He returns to tell his co - worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich 's mind , she does n't NOT_believe NOT_him but after she sees it it changes her mind . Lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all . John malkovich of course has no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_is NOT_going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we do n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_really NOT_happened . John cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play . He fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast . Cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world 's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive . She however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date . Catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself . The whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever . Spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film . He lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie . By the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was . The screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought - provoking . The film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart - warming . The whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles . From cameron diaz 's appearence to john malkovich 's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) . There is n't NOT_a NOT_slow NOT_point NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie , NOT_or NOT_an NOT_overused NOT_idea . There are no NOT_cliches NOT_except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i 've seen in a long time . I found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie . By the end i had to wonder why hollywood does n't NOT_want to make movies like this anymore . Or why they do n't . All filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out . This was a surprise hit as was american beauty . ' being john malkovich ' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made . It has something that no NOT_other NOT_movies NOT_playing now has . In fact it may as well be the best movie out right now . I highly recommend ' being john malkovich ' and have no NOT_doubts NOT_you NOT_will NOT_be NOT_disappointed .", "this book is important for every one who has a back \" issue \" .   given 5 as gifts to loved one 's experiencing back pain", "Very Happy with the Sofitel Roma .

I 'll be growing some next year", "The 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films . One was _ gattaca _ . The other was _ the thirteenth floor _ . Just as _ gattaca _ was overshadowed by the mighty _ titanic _ , _ the thirteenth floor _ was relegated to obscurity by _ the matrix _ . However , _ the thirteeth floor _ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _ matrix _ . A cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller - stahl ) , is murdered . His associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery . Along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture . _ the thirteenth floor _ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise . The result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view . First , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline . Second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel . No NOT_wonder NOT_it NOT_fell NOT_through NOT_the NOT_cracks . Done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels . Many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment . I recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie . Despite its philosophical challenges , _ the thirteenth floor _ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller . In that sense it is more akin to _ gattaca _ than _ the matrix _ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no NOT_emotional NOT_depth NOT_whatsoever . The moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging . In its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane 's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one . Although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep - seated character flaw . In fact , hannon fuller 's activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane 's husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters . This is not NOT_a NOT_film NOT_of NOT_good NOT_people NOT_beset NOT_from NOT_without NOT_by NOT_great NOT_evil . The tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves . The major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well . Bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _ the long kiss goodnight _ , is outstanding . D'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance . The lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _ casablanca _ , does a wonderful job . Her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times . This could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script . Some minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places . There are one or two instances of jerky editing . The script takes the edge off the film 's climaxes . The atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . One wonders if even after two decades , _ blade runner _ is still casting its long shadow over sci - fi films . One can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _ amadeus _ : \" make it more like_blade runner _ , you know , dark and rainy . \" _ the thirteen floor _ is that rare exception among hollywood movies : a , rich , emotionally satisfying , intelligent sci - fi movie . And yet , ultimately , it proves the suits right . For when good sci - fi is made , where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it ? If we do n't support great sf , who will ?", "Vita La Dolce .

Now , I bought the 2000 \" expansion \" release of this concert which at the time was dubbed the \" complete concert recording \" . It was misleading because I had seen the British documentary ( the DVD of this is included in the set)in which Johnny &   friends were performing songs I never knew existed from this legendary event because they were absent on CD . Now this is the full sha - bang , complete with amazing packaging , the concert spread over two CDs , and the DVD mentioned above . If you bought the previous CD like I did , let me tell you , this is worth the upgrade as it seems this is the \" definitive end to all release \" of Johnny singing to the boys at San Quentin . For new fans , the single CD release might be the best place to start since it has at least 85 % of what Johnny sang that night at San Quentin . The rest of the legacy tracks feature The Carter Family , Carl Perkins , and The Statler Bros . So if you 're looking for a \" Johnny Cash \" solo concert , then get the single CD version .

What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances ( including Roberts ) .   Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot .   It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are", "Nice hotel with a pool . . .

It 's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style : for example \" Lisa , \" \" Amy , \" \" Susan \" and \" Dawn \" were very popular for babies born in the 60s ( and thus , my classmates ) , but are rarely used today .

Firstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship . Secondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes . Thirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose . Finally , the groom - wannabe should probably get her parent 's blessing . Of these four , the last one can be a nightmare . Meeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression . If you 're lucky , things will go smoothly . But , if you 're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong . And with a name like that , how could it not ? When greg first meets his fianc ? e 's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive . When he tells jack that he 's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , \" not NOT_many NOT_men NOT_in NOT_your NOT_profession , NOT_huh , NOT_greg ? \" It 's definitely not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_start . But greg is determined to win him over , and it 's this desire that fuels the movie . He first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner . It does n't NOT_matter NOT_that NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_jewish . If daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that 's what he 's going to gamely do . \" oh god ... you 're Such a good god \" , he moons . His discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the \" deniro squint \" ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it 's pretty hard not NOT_to NOT_grin . Things get progressively worse for greg . And that 's too bad because he 's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart . Eventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people . It 's a never - ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes . He buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances . He tries to find jack 's missing cat . But his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble . And there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness . The more our well - meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy . We liked greg .

We laugh at greg 's expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool . Deniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside . Their tug - of - war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in - laws from hell .", "Fantastic Hotel . .

Often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . When one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no NOT_way NOT_one NOT_person NOT_could NOT_possible NOT_carry the entire project on his shoulders . But sometimes there is simply no NOT_other NOT_explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" This biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison 's ' the hurricane , ' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . But though he does decent work , jewison can not NOT_claim NOT_ownership NOT_of \" NOT_the NOT_hurricane , \" NOT_because NOT_there NOT_is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . Washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late - night shooting in a bar . Jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . The situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . Through the efforts of that group and carter 's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . The film details carter 's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . When he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . Despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . Flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african - american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . The book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra 's eyes to the injustice that was carter 's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . Lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . He must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . It 's probably accurate to say that washington does not NOT_embody NOT_rubin NOT_carter , NOT_because NOT_he NOT_plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . It would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter -- a fictional personality invented solely for the film . The actor 's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm 's length . We feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . Washington 's is a performance of weight and emotional depth . He does n't NOT_merely NOT_play NOT_angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . His work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . Norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no NOT_scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . Jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing NOT_is NOT_terribly NOT_confusing . His boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . Jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . Jewison 's best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard - knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . Sadly , though , the film 's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good - but - not - NOT_great efforts to round the pike this winter . There is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . Take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . Carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype . The canadians are good . The cops are bad . The canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey - dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film 's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya 's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room . Much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( \" hate put me in prison . Love 's gon na bust me out . \") , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made - for - tv lifetime special . It 's too bad . The cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often . I wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than \" he 's a racist pig . \" I wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice . In short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens . Criticism has been levied against the liberties \" the hurricane \" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved . For example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner . Most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly . Furthermore , much of carter 's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained . Of course , \" the hurricane \" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues do n't NOT_remove NOT_one NOT_fact : \" the hurricane \" is a highly flawed film . Only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it 's a good thing \" the hurricane \" has that actor . Carter has been quoted as saying , \" denzel washington is making me look good , \" but he 's not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_one . Washington makes this film look good . Denzel washington 's \" the hurricane . \" Sounds pretty good to me .", "Wonderful hotel . This is a fantastic small hotel in the heart of Trastevere . I stayed here based on the reviews . It did not NOT_disappoint . I primarily chose the hotel based on price . I stayed for 2 nights . This was my 2nd trip to Rome . The first time . I stayed by the Spanish Steps . I plan on staying in Trastevere and this hotel when I return to Rome . The restaurants in the area are great . Trastevere has more of a neighborhood feel than the center of Rome plus its easily accessable to the major sites . The hotel itself is charming and clean . Breakfast on the terrace was a nice way to start the day .", "Elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s . It is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings . Internally , the catholics wage war against the protestants . Meanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power . Little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival . The film charts elizabeth 's tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom . As a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen . But her half - sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne . Mary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land . Once declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely - eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad . Slowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom . Elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers . Her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance ) . Also on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well - meaning but misguided chief adviser . With few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self - worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron - fisted ruler she secretly despises . Blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth . She portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self - consciousness and shrewd charisma . Though not NOT_a NOT_classical NOT_beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk . She is at home with her character 's playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes ) . Whether fending off unctuous suitors or \" playing \" the houses in court , blanchett 's elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike . Almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur 's visual delights . He and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes . Rolling green hills , extravagant ceremonial galas , dark and foreboding corridors -- all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation . The castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here . Though writer michael hirst 's script gets a little murky at times , and his injections of humor get a little overplayed , elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing . As a whole , the story survives because elizabeth 's struggle is one which deserves attention . By the time she makes her shocking ( but very sensible ) final declaration , we 're ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen .", "Yes , Ben Witherington is a ( relative ) conservative , but do n't NOT_hold NOT_that NOT_against him . Yes , he has strong opinions , but do n't NOT_hold NOT_that NOT_against NOT_him , NOT_either , NOT_because NOT_they NOT_are well argued . The fact remains that this is the best overview of & quot;Third Quest&quot ; Jesus scholarship I have been able to find . Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not NOT_appreciate NOT_his NOT_critique , but it is very fair and well - thought out . One of the benefits from a book like this , besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research , is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well - rounded portrait of the Savior . No NOT_one NOT_scholar gets it right all the time ( not NOT_even NOT_Witherington , with his own view of Jesus as God 's wisdom ) , but the different insights are valuable , because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend . That should be a cause for humility ( something some Jesus scholars have lacked , at least in print ) . I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship", "To learn some Italian before visiting Italy , I tried multiple language - learning programs borrowed from my local library . Some were ridiculous , many required using a workbook .   Then I stumbled on the Pimsleur program , which is totally audio , allowing me to learn Italian while I drove to and from work . Due to the pedagogically- sound method Pimsleur developed for language learning , I actually did learn some basic Italian .   As a result I bought \" Conversational Italian . \" Though I 've never considered myself adept at language - learning , I actually felt confident in my ablility to learn Italian as a result of these CDs . I 've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language", "Of the major horror sub - genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable . Think about it . Frankenstein movies have n't NOT_changed NOT_all NOT_that NOT_much NOT_because NOT_they NOT_still NOT_need NOT_that NOT_mad - NOT_scientist - NOT_in - NOT_bavarian - NOT_castle NOT_setting . If you made a frankenstein movie today , you 'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j. fox , there are n't NOT_any NOT_actors NOT_that NOT_could NOT_play NOT_a NOT_virus NOT_convincingly . Movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt .

( and there 's that michael j. fox thing again . ) But you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about . You can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker 's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) . You can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) . Were it not NOT_redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires . Any day now , i expect we 'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record . Or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade . Wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path . In this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses . Snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u. s. marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half - vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers . Blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires NOT_without a shred of remorse . He is as cold as his silver - bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic - filled bullets . Yet , he 's not without NOT_quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent . Like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action . For some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti - vampire weapons of garlic and silver . ( blade dismisses a man - portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . ) Unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles . The replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i did n't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i could n't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat 's performance . Blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it 's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance . With a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment . As it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .", "Hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like Lady Sovereign . She is not NOT_only NOT_lyrically NOT_impressive , but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving , which is basically what she sets out to do . I do nt know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the UK , but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now . And i will patiently await for S.O.V. debut US album . Favorite Track , though all of it is really good , will have to be \" The Battle \" feature other grime scene artists like Shystie , Zuz Rock , and Frost P spitting the wildest ( barely NOT_understandable lol ) rhymes i ve heard . No NOT_men and women have battled against each other like this , especially for the listening public . How ever , no NOT_one should compare SOV to anyone ( Missy or M.I.A. ) All emcees , particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such .

Love it", "Luckily , some people got starship troopers . Some people knew it was supposed to be silly . For those of you who did NOT_n't , how could you miss it ? From the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet - like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly . I guess without NOT_blatant NOT_one - NOT_liners NOT_and NOT_home NOT_alone NOT_style NOT_slapstick , NOT_some NOT_people NOT_just NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_recognize NOT_such NOT_goofy NOT_humor . Such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned . First thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up . Meet the equivalent of \" beverly hills 90210 \" meets \" mighty morphin power rangers \" . Four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country . Johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot . Dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it 's possible she 's joining merely to follow rico , whom she 's always had eyes for . If you saw these three on the street , you 'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie 's cast looked so much like the cut - out cover of \" seventeen \" magazine . The lone non - supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture . ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) . Right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time . But a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits . With his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home . Well sorry , rico suave , but there 's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it . That 's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid - like alien beings that a can of raid just is n't going to destroy . With a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs . What starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci - fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously . It 's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it 's not as recognizably so . It 's a spoof so subtle that many wo n't recognize the spoofery . If you deem this as sci - fi / action , you 're wrong . It 's sci - fi / action / comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well . Gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy . Yes , it 's graphic , but it 's also brutally phony , and that 's what makes it such great fun to watch . Not since the old \" mr . bill \" skits on \" saturday night live \" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch . People were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated . Perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters ' barbie dolls as young children . With the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it 's a good chance this is the case , whether we 're fully aware of it or not . Starship troopers has it 's slow parts , but it 's truly an alternative to your typical sci - fi / action flick or lame juvenile comedy . Aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding . When the spaceship passes a meteor , it 's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating . If you 're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search . A beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast - paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore .

You do n't NOT_mess NOT_with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" The combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non - stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . The formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . I 'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow - up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . Surprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no NOT_time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . The script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no NOT_time getting to the point right from the start . Terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . Concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . Instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . The makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . We , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already - existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . That chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . Little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" First and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan 's artistry in fight choreography . The 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not NOT_disappoint . Chan 's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . His moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . Like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . Chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . When he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . When lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . The comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . The combo of chan 's flying feet and fists with tucker 's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . The supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . John lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . Lone does n't NOT_chew NOT_scenery NOT_or NOT_make NOT_pronouncements NOT_to \" NOT_get NOT_lee NOT_and NOT_carter , \" NOT_but NOT_gives NOT_the NOT_chief NOT_bad NOT_guy NOT_elegance . Zhang zi - yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky 's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one - on - one melee at the conclusion . ) Roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she does n't NOT_add NOT_much NOT_to NOT_the NOT_equation NOT_but NOT_is NOT_terrific NOT_to NOT_watch . Director ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . Cinematographer matthew f. leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . Production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . The rest of the techs are of the same high quality . I 'm surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . It takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer .

Each   essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and   thirteenth century Europe .   At issue in each are the questions of what or   who held the power to command or punish , and how that power was obtained ,   kept and manifested .   This is a truly enlightening book . Of particular   interest are the essays on holding power over the truth , as well as those   dealing the formation of the nobility into a self - consciously chivalric   warrior class .

No NOT_matter . \" Graffiti Bridge \" , Prince 's first album of the 90 's , is also one of Prince 's best albums of the 90's . \"New Power Generation \" serves as the title track to Prince 's new band , and it 's a powerful , funky manifesto . \" The Question of U \" is exotic and intoxicating . \" Elephants and Flowers \" is an upbeat song about spiritual redemption , whereas \" Tick Tick Bang \" is Prince at his most joyously raunchy . Although most of Prince 's material is exceptionally strong here , the collaborations and contributions by other artists are a mixed bag . \" We Can Funk \" is a simmering duet between Prince and funkmaster George Clinton , and Tevin Campbell provides some youthful exuberance to \" Round and Round \" .

White people thought themselves superior to others , especially the Chinese . Chinese were often looked down upon and shunned , mainly because of their religious beliefs . The lighthouse keeper 's daughter , however , was different from other white people . Believing her father 's talks about Chinese people in the beginning of the story , the girl , Eliza Jane , meets a Chinese boy around her age . After the Chinese boy saves her goat , Eliza becomes interested in the boy 's behavior . Soon , she learns that everyone may not NOT_be NOT_as NOT_they NOT_seemed .     This story was rather interesting in a way . The time of the story show how the characters act and think . The story also shows how different some characters are , such as Eliza 's father and mother . ( \" Something moved inside me , like a sudden shift in the wind . \" ) Eliza was also , in a way , different from other white people . She befriended and showed kindness toward the Chinese boy . ( \" ` You 'll do him no NOT_harm ? I have your word on it ? ' \" ) I was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the Chinese boy .     Of all of the stories I have read , I have never found one that was perfect . This story is no NOT_different . When the Chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people , I could feel the same shock and anger Eliza felt . The story , however , has a few more bad parts . One boy , Amos , accidentally broke Eliza Jane 's nose while trying to find the Chinese boy . Afraid that he might get in trouble , the boy lied to his father about breaking Eliza 's nose . To make matters worse , Amos blames the fault on the Chinese boy ! ( \" I had a mind to shout at him , to tell him to put her down ... \" ) On the other hand , I did not NOT_like NOT_how NOT_Eliza NOT_acted NOT_toward NOT_the NOT_Chinese NOT_boy NOT_when NOT_they NOT_first NOT_met . When the boy yelled a warning , Eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat . Therefore , when the boy was holding the goat , Eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her , when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave . Even so , that was not NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_part NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story . ( \" ` Get you from me , ' he said . ` I ca n't NOT_be NOT_near NOT_you NOT_now . Get out of my sight ! ' \" ) As a father , Eliza 's father was expected by me to listen and talk to Eliza about her Chinese friend , and maybe even understand why she was protecting him . As a result , I was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not NOT_even NOT_want to talk to her ! Thankfully , there was nothing NOT_worse NOT_than NOT_this NOT_part NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story .     ( \" Terrible things can happen in this world - things you ca n't NOT_explain NOT_away .

It was close enough to be able to spend the day in Pisa yet far enough away to escape and enjoy some quite family time . We drove to Florence for a day trip that was wonderful . The drive was so scenic that it almost overshadowed our trip to Florence . We found that early morning or late afternoon was the best time to go most places as the crowds really thinned out compared to mid - day . We stayed at the Greenpark Resort in Tirennia . Its a bit pricey but well worth the money . The only drawbacks were the price of dinner at the hotel and the pool closes at 5 pm . Of course there are plenty of great resturants in Tirennia and some of the beaches are open later in the evening . Days in Pisa or Florence and nights in Tirennia walking along the beach made for a great trip and when we go back again next summer we are planning on staying at the same place . After 5 days we left Pisa for Venice so the rest of the trip will be posted there .", "Walzer 's historical approach to examining just war theory is , I think , the most useful way to understand morality in war . That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations . Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here ; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying , if not NOT_prescribing , moral norms from which the rules have been extracted . Be forewarned , he does not NOT_cut NOT_the NOT_reader NOT_any NOT_slack . This book requires some serious attention to the author 's train of thought .   Just war theory has two categories : the justice of going to war , and the justice of fighting once in a war . Walzer 's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere . In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service . His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war . One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that \" all is fair in love and war . \" That is the path of least moral resistance ( or as Clausewitz would say , \" friction \" ) , yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers . What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age - old notion , something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected .   Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many .   Originally coined by the Romans it seems ( Walzer quotes them , \" In war the laws are silent \" ) , they themselves were self - consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians .   The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone . Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist -- far from it .   On the otherside some critics find his argument about \" supreme emergency \" a moral failure and a cop - out .   The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency , one where normal rules may be relaxed , if ever so little , because of the especially pernicious nature of state - sponsored genocide .   The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror . In contrast Walzer does not NOT_see NOT_Imperial NOT_Japan , NOT_for NOT_instance , NOT_as NOT_having NOT_represented NOT_a NOT_supreme NOT_emergency , and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not NOT_be NOT_morally NOT_justified . Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell 's perspective in the essay \" Thank God for the Atom Bomb . \"Significantly for current events , readers interested in the distinction between pre - emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here . The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre - emptive .   That impulse on the part of the neo - conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects , I think , a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy . There is no NOT_way NOT_that NOT_attack NOT_can NOT_be NOT_justified under the historically accepted norms of \" pre - emption . \" Michael Walzer 's well - thought distinction between pre - emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism , and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start , regardless of its practical success down the road , if we are fortunate enough to see that . The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future . The fact that Iraq was not NOT_even NOT_on NOT_the NOT_spectrum NOT_where NOT_the NOT_fine NOT_line NOT_between NOT_pre - NOT_emption NOT_and NOT_prevention NOT_exists NOT_is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco .   Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground , one is doomed to moral failure . Walzer was vocal about the run - up to war in 2003 , and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion ; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world 's police force", "Perfect location .

I knew the film would be funny -- the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . But i also knew the film would be an equal - opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . I figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . I may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? I needn+t have worried . + mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all - out laugh - and - grossfest this side of _ animal house _ . Surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . They make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . The plot is typical . Thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . As luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . Why , i shall not NOT_tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . He hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . He becomes one of the great comic villains . Upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . It is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double - crossed , and goes to get her for himself . Would the geek get the girl ? Puh - lease . The ending is pure hollywood ; no NOT_surprises NOT_there . But the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged - up dogs . The dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . And yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . Mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . She is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w. Earl brown -- miles away from the cameraman in _ scream _ ) . Mary+s sunniness carries the film here -- it compliments the below - belt gags that come at you . Cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not NOT_usually NOT_undress before an open window . Ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _ reality bites _ and _ flirting with disaster _ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . Braces , greasy long hair , not NOT_too NOT_bright , and very very funny . Dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . And rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador / greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . Not NOT_everything works . Chris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . There+s lousy dialogue about eight - minute vs. seven minute exercise tapes . And there are long stretches without NOT_much NOT_going NOT_on . But the wait is worth it . When those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . Belly - aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . The farrelly brothers have finally done it . Yes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_bad as it could have been . While tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not NOT_with NOT_me . While raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _ porky+s _ or _ boogie nights _ . And it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . After the funny but sour _ kingpin _ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _ a fish called wanda _ .

This is a lovely hotel . well appointed in a convenient location .", "I remember making a pact , right after ` patch adams ' , to not NOT_be NOT_easily NOT_be NOT_suckered NOT_by movies dripping with sentimentality . But darn it , ` music of the heart ' is just layered with feel - good material and bright characterizations . It 's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it 's manipulation . In addition , it 's also a terrific family film . This is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools . It could also be described as ` mrs . Streep 's opus ' . Yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad . Out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta 's character and grasp her academic point - of - view . She is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ? Slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied . One thoroughly interesting fact about ` music of the heart ' lies with the unlikely presence in the director 's chair : horror veteran wes craven . After leaving an impression with the ` scream ' films and the original ` nightmare on elm street ' , craven has attempted a precarious cross - over to drama . At first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material . It does n't NOT_carry NOT_the NOT_heart - NOT_warming NOT_courage NOT_of NOT_` NOT_mr . NOT_Holland NOT_'s NOT_opus ' , but ` music of the heart ' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth . The tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate . Yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it 's the solid ensemble cast that makes ` music of the heart ' work . Angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially does n't NOT_hire NOT_roberta NOT_because of her lack of experience . Blue - eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest . Gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second - grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force . It 's like a schoolteacher 's version of ` thelma and louise ' , in a restrained but effective manner . The movie tackles more issues than just guaspari 's teaching of violin . There 's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman . In it 's dramatic build - up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth . It 's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_life - NOT_altering NOT_decision . It 's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross - over , and also for achieving his intricate goal . Watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed ` scream ' ? Of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed ` music of the heart ' ? Mission accomplished , wes . Thankfully , there is no NOT_layer NOT_of NOT_artificial NOT_sentiment NOT_covering the film . In it 's entirety , it 's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile .

The uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but ` music of the heart ' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals .", "\" The Climb \" was written by Bourkeev and DeWalt as an answer to Krakaur 's \" Into Thin Air \" . While not NOT_showcasing NOT_the NOT_same NOT_prose as Krakaur 's book , I feel that this is utlamitely better . My reasoning for this opinion is that \" The Climb \" seems like a much more fair and unbiased account . Bourkeev does not NOT_resort NOT_to playing the blame game ; he simply tells the story as he experienced it . Krakaur , it seemed to me at least , relied to heavily on assumptions , and we all now what happens when you assume ( hint : you make an _ _ _ _ _ out of you and me ) and came off as very arrogant and ( for some reason ) took a feverious dislike to Bourkeev and Lopsang . Thought not NOT_as NOT_well NOT_written as \" Into Thin Air \" , \" The Climb \" still managed to draw me in fully , although some parts of the book are a little confusing , mainly the interview with Bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed . This interview was conducted in English , the only problem with that is that Bourkeev 's English is not NOT_very NOT_strong ! It is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper . DeWalt tries to help by adding \" translations \" about what Bourkeev is saying but I felt the interview should have been caried out in Bourkeev 's native tongue of Russian and then translated into English . To not NOT_have NOT_done NOT_this is a great injustice to Bourkeev . If you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the May 1996 Everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not NOT_to NOT_play NOT_smeer NOT_tatics and make money ( as Krakaur 's clearly was ) , read this .

His girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him . Enter a 5-year old kid , who 's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who 's off in china on a business trip . From there , coufax basically acts as the kid 's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks . He even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who are n't NOT_particularly NOT_pleased with coufax 's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid . The reason i say it 's not NOT_really sandler 's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow did n't NOT_really NOT_belong NOT_in a sandler vehicle .

As the story unfolds , we find that many things are n't NOT_exactly NOT_as NOT_they NOT_seem ( that 's as much as i could NOT_say without ruining anything ) . Critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout . Mind you , i could see many people not NOT_liking NOT_it because it takes \" one too many \" twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing . And besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even \" explained \" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not NOT_leave NOT_the NOT_theatre NOT_before NOT_you NOT_see the credits ... it Really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) . Other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her \" good girl stereotypical \" role into a pot - smoking , goth - looking white trash chick out for a good time . Denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood 's jelly - donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants need n't NOT_lead NOT_to lawsuits . Bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) . Sprinkle the story with a bunch o ' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding - dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage - a - trois , and you 've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre . On the down side , the soundtrack was not NOT_as NOT_prominent ( NOT_or NOT_slick ) NOT_as NOT_i NOT_thought NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible .... ooooh , I almost forgot bill murray 's exquisite role as the down - trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court . Murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery . Little known facts : neve campbell specified a non - nudity clause in her contract ( she 's also born in guelph , ontario ... go Hoser ! ) Director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous . Kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called \" six degrees of kevin bacon \" .", "I discovered Seal the same way that most people did : through his utterly beautiful song \" Kiss From A Rose \" .   I heard it on the radio one day , and played it constantly for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the album the song was from .   As it happens , the song is from Seal 's most revered album , his multi - platinum 1994 self - titled album .   ( This is not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_confused NOT_with NOT_his NOT_other NOT_self - NOT_titled NOT_album , NOT_his NOT_debut , NOT_released NOT_in NOT_1991 . )   I did n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_to NOT_expect NOT_when NOT_I NOT_bought NOT_the NOT_album , NOT_having NOT_heard NOT_only NOT_one NOT_song NOT_from NOT_it , but months after purchasing it I 'm glad I made the gamble . I think that the sub - genre which best classifies SEAL is urban .   Urban music , according to All Music Guide , is smooth and polished , often romantic , sometimes uptempo and funky , and features soulful vocals .   SEAL has all of this and more .   It has techno beats , but they 're not NOT_as NOT_overwhelming NOT_as NOT_one NOT_might NOT_expect .   They blend together with peaceful , occasionally ethereal guitars and Seal 's incredibly soothing singing .   This is , no NOT_doubt , NOT_stylish NOT_music , but first and foremost it 's a collection of warm , encouraging songs penned by a very talented musician .   There 's NOT_nothing that comes close to being a bad song here ; there 's not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_slightly NOT_weak NOT_composition .   Thus it 's a little harder to pick highlights than usual .   Some highlights include the strong opening track , \" Bring It On \" ; the emotional hit \" Prayer For The Dying \" ; the shimmering \" Dreaming In Metaphors \" ; the upbeat \" Newborn Friend \" ; and , needless to say , the absolutely wonderful \" Kiss From A Rose \" .   The closing track , \" Bring It On ( Reprise ) \" is another beautiful song , but \" Kiss From A Rose \" is possibly the most lovely song I 've ever heard .   Listening to it in the warmth of one 's home during a snowy December afternoon is an incredibly powerful experience . The message of the album , if there is one , is \" Keep on going - life is beautiful ! \"   It could fail under any other popular artist , but Seal succeeds marvelously .   This is some of the most heartfelt , inspirational singing I 've ever heard .   There 's a delightful optimism in Seal 's singing that sounds strong rather than naiive .   It 's hard to feel down after listening to such an uplifting album as this .   Seal is certainly one of the most talented musicians of R&B ( or rock - you decide ) .   These songs have clear , strong messages , warm , inspirational lyrics , heartfelt , soothing singing , danceable beats , and a whole lot of emotion . Once you 've heard \" Kiss From A Rose \" , I guarantee you 'll want to pick up the album .   If you 're already thinking of doing so , then I encourage you to go forward and buy it ; you wo n't NOT_regret NOT_it .   It 's become one of my favorite albums .   When you 're feeling disillusioned or depressed with the state of your life or just life in general , look no NOT_further NOT_than SEAL to make you cherish it once again .", "This is a wonderful effort by the Del Castillo brothers and their band . Mark and Rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever heard .

The pattern continues with the new star trek : first contact , an energetic sci - fi adventure that ( coincidentally ? ) is the eighth entry in the hugely popular series . In this first trek feature to feature only cast members from the late star trek : the next generation television series , captain jean - luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the 24th - century crew of the starship enterprise -- commander will riker ( jonathan frakes , who also directed ) , android lt . cmdr . Data ( brent spiner ) , lt . cmdr . Geordi laforge ( levar burton ) , lt . cmdr . Worf ( michael dorn ) , dr . beverly crusher ( gates mcfadden ) , and counselor deanna troi ( marina sirtis ) --travel back to 21st - century earth while doing battle with the borg , a race of cybernetic beings that share a collective mind with the borg queen ( alice krige ) . The borg intend to alter history and assimilate all of humankind into their race -- starting with the earth - orbiting crew of the enterprise and a 21st century stowaway ( alfre woodard ) . This is an interesting plotline that is sure to mesmerize trekkers everywhere and engage everyone else , but , unfortunately , it only makes up the star trek half of the script by brannon braga and ronald d. moore . The other half of the title -- first contact -- refers to a subplot that takes place on 21st - century earth , where riker , troi , and laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran ( james cromwell ) , who is about to embark on the first warp speed flight in human history , which directly leads to the first contact with extraterrestrials . While this story does tie into the main plot and pays off interestingly in the end , it is nowhere near as involving or exciting as the borg battles on the enterprise . Not NOT_helping NOT_matters is the tiresome cochran character , an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny but becomes too one - note after a while . In the end , though , the first contact subplot does n't NOT_detract NOT_from NOT_the NOT_enjoyment NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film NOT_as NOT_a NOT_whole . The story is typical sci - fi fantasy , but the conviction of the cast -- most notably the always - phenomenal stewart -- makes you believe and care . Frakes , making his feature directorial debut , keeps the action swiftly rolling along and delivers the action goods , even upping the violence a notch ( this is the first trek film to bear a pg-13 rating ) to greater effect . St : fc has a bigger budget than the last trek outing , the middling star trek generations , and it definitely shows on screen -- the production design and especially visual and makeup effects are outstanding ( in particular those involving the borg queen ) . Braga and moore 's mostly sharp script will please both trek devotees and the rest ; the references to the borg storyline in the tv series , the continuity with the previous film ( e. g. The ongoing saga of data 's emotion chip ) , and a fleeting star trek : voyager crossover will make trekkers squeal with delight , but such points are made easily accessible to those less familiar to the trek mythos . Paramount was reportedly worried about the staying power of its trek franchise with the next generation cast now carrying the helm . Based on the entertaining success that is star trek : first contact , i 'd say the studio has nothing NOT_to NOT_worry NOT_about ( NOT_at NOT_least NOT_not NOT_until NOT_this NOT_cast NOT_retires NOT_and NOT_the NOT_crew NOT_of NOT_the NOT_wan NOT_star NOT_trek : NOT_deep NOT_space NOT_nine NOT_takes over ... ) .", "3 Stars . Excellent value for the price . At the last minute we needed a hotel in the center . We checked with Hotel Reservations . yellow sign with black writing . at the Rome Termini train station .

The AC Heater was not NOT_working NOT_so NOT_well NOT_but NOT_was NOT_not NOT_an NOT_issue . It was cold out and the heat only came on and did not adjust by the dial . Also the shower head was not working so I used the euro style hand held shower which worked great . The TV was small but you will not use it in Rome . Breakfast was typical continental and good . The staff was very friendly and held our bags after checkout so we could walk around . Much of the staff were foreigners . mostly Russians I think . and that may account for what some reviews take as being rude . I think their enlgish is not so good so maybe that is why . but I found them to be polite . It is very close to everything and yes . its better to walk than to go by vehicle . traffic is terrible at all times . There was street noise always but the location and price and cleanliness of the hotel overcame all the low points . I would recommend it for a few nites and would go back for sure .", "John sayles ' \" men with guns \" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power . The film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers . Most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in - between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists . All people not NOT_fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness . However , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity . There is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it . The film 's main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category . One of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive . Fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians . With government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate . This program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea . However , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not NOT_turned NOT_out NOT_as NOT_he NOT_has NOT_envisioned . As he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other . When dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , \" because they had guns , and we did n't . \" Rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others ' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power . Dr. fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss . First , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father . Next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities . Through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self - respect , and defines himself only by his pistol . Along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith . As domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching . Last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who has n't NOT_spoken NOT_since NOT_she NOT_was NOT_raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her . Sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in \" men with guns . \" ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer - than - necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . ) He creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo . Their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film 's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo 's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes ' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is is NOT_n't ) . The setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself . Sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth - century coal mining town in \" matewan \" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas / mexico bordertown in \" lone star \" ( 1996 ) . Sayles is not NOT_a NOT_particularly NOT_inventive NOT_director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( \" gattaca \" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain . Sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects . The one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not NOT_only NOT_as NOT_comic NOT_relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border . It would not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_stretch NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that \" NOT_men NOT_with NOT_guns \" NOT_is NOT_a NOT_depressing NOT_film . In fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure . In addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo 's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being . Nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly . The last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , \" nobody refuses the men with guns . \"", "In this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book , Hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century . The often dense text is supplemented by biographical details , witty asides , and ( especially ) luxuriously reproduced introductions . Hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages ; he hopes to provide brief , non - intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science . There is astonishingly little text , and at times the pithiness , compactness , and occasional \" cuteness \" may work against readers ' understanding ; there 's perhaps too much shell and not NOT_enough nut here . Some sections are so cursory that I suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader . ( This is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time , event horizons , and brane world models . ) The text is aided greatly , however , by the beautifully rendered four - color illustrations . Even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first , the creativity and humor fused into Moonrunner Design 's artwork will attract , engage , and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation . Overall , then , the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated . Yet it 's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further . If you 're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here , I strongly recommend ( as does Hawking ) Alan Guth 's \" The Inflationary Universe \" or Brian Greene 's \" The Elegant Universe .", "First of all i 'm a die hard UFO fan , i own EVERY UFO album not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_michael NOT_shenker NOT_cd's ... some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums NOT_without michael .. 1 ) do the band a disservice 2)are smokin crack , and 3 ) are very inept in your musical judgement .

Her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no NOT_proof NOT_that NOT_god NOT_existed , so therefor she does not NOT_believe . Ellie also believes in aliens , and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist . How can she say she does n't NOT_believe NOT_in NOT_god NOT_because of the lack of proof , and then say she believes in aliens , which are gereally less believed in than god NOT_without sounding like a hypocrite ? That 's the catch-22 . When aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them ( okay , well , they did NOT_n't really * fax * them ... ) Ellie wants to be the one to go , but because of her atheism she is denied the position .

I 'm glad at least one movie of the ' 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light , rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body .", "\" sometimes the ' green mile ' seems sooooo long . \" Indeed . And any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review . On a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length . The mile in question ( green due to its faded lime - colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to \" old sparky , \" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana 's cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 . Paul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you 've got mail ) is the head guard of e - block , otherwise known as death row . Keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility . It is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they \" talk to \" the convicts instead of yelling at them . This practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars . Into his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls . Immediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner . Perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark . Or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he \" takes back \" paul 's bladder infection thereby restoring him to health . Based on steven king 's 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner \" fry \" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he 's witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor . While it is mr . hanks \" everyman \" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting . All involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization . If only the story were more credible . Writer / director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy / allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power . Mr. darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters . Was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ? By not NOT_knowing NOT_the NOT_reason for the condemned convicts ' presence on e - block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted . This is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched . Much has also been made of coffey 's christ - like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey 's powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo - like \" i feel your pain \" transference . In contrast , there is no NOT_mystery NOT_associated with the healing that is from god . The genuine \" gifts of healing \" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god . True spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed . Such believing comes not NOT_from NOT_the NOT_shrouded NOT_secrets NOT_of NOT_mysticism , NOT_but NOT_from NOT_the NOT_revealed NOT_word NOT_of NOT_god .", "Really nothing NOT_on NOT_this NOT_is NOT_bad .

Van damme and rodman have nice chemistry , the stunts are eyepopping , and stuff gets blowed up real good ; what more do you want ? I admit i was all set to loathe double team ; it reeked of cheapjack timing - oriented marketing ( stick dennis rodman in a movie , quick , while he 's hot , and do something about jean - claude van damme 's flagging career while we 're at it ! ) . Surprise -- double team transcends its dumb roots and turns out to be a mess of fun . Bring some friends , get some pretzels , and have a blast . Van damme is jack quinn , an ex - agent who is brought back in for \" one last mission \" -- you 'd think any spy worth his shoe phone would run like hell when he hears those words . But van damme 's character has a pregnant wife who 's also a sculptor , and some unpleasant pressure gets used to get him to come through on this mission . He 's been assigned to take down an old enemy , a terrorist named stavros ( mickey rourke , looking oddly subdued ) , who may be back up to his old tricks . In the first showdown between quinn and stavros , the movie wears its ambitions proudly on its sleeve : nonstop action . An amusement park , a hospital , a private \" retired spy \" 's retreat , most of rome , various houses , planes , cars and other modes of transport , and the coliseum ( ! ) All become arenas for some of the most bone - rattling shoot - outs and punch - outs filmed . They are better seen than described and are reason enough to see the film : one jaw - dropping scene has van damme taking on a man who uses a switchblade with his * feet * . ( van damme is a good , dextrous athlete and fighter , but he is often upstaged . ) There are other nice touches . Stavros and quinn both want the same thing : to retire in peace with their families . That ambition ties them together in various ways , and also humanizes them a bit . One of the things about hk action movies is that there 's always some form of human element , and that 's carried over into this movie as well . It gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable . Also good is dennis rodman , playing a weapons dealer named yaz -- a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there .

A poorly - written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well - written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs . In directing his latest action - comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get - out buddy cop movie . In addition , rush hour serves as a first - class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types . The two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together . Jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts . The other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no NOT_chance NOT_against the content of this one . Chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there 's no NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_a NOT_large NOT_percentage NOT_of NOT_video NOT_sales NOT_for NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_will NOT_come from viewers who could n't NOT_believe NOT_their NOT_eyes NOT_the NOT_first NOT_time . Chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan 's performance . He works perfectly with the script , and it 's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines . Almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent . We 're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd . Cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters . The fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help . The fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective . It 's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up . Rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it does n't NOT_quite NOT_reach NOT_the NOT_top NOT_tier NOT_of NOT_action - NOT_comedies NOT_like NOT_last NOT_year NOT_'s NOT_grosse NOT_pointe NOT_blank . There are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_comedic NOT_interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback . Also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing . However , none NOT_gives NOT_a NOT_standoffish NOT_performance and they mostly mesh into the background . Almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it 's tucker 's toned - down routine or chan 's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types . A recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .", "Would highly recommend the Allesandra Della Spina . We found the hotel to be in a good location . off the main road and so quiet at night .

Incidentally , the Swedish edition gives the authors name as Kallistos Ware , apparently his taken Orthodox name , while Timothy Ware is his original , given name . In Sweden , the Swedish translation of \" The Orthodox Church \" is the only readily available book on the history of the Orthodox Church . Apparently , its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on Church history . It also contains chapters on theology and worship . In my opinion , the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in Orthodox Church history . Its first chapters summarize the history of this Church during the Byzantine Empire , under Islam , and in Russia both before and during Communism . Of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the Catholic - Orthodox split , usually dated to 1054 . The author believes that the so - called Fourth Crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split . However , the book must also be read with some reservations . The author is , after all , an Orthodox Christian himself . Its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there . For instance , Ware denies that the Byzantine Church was caesaropapist , a very untenable suggestion . At other times , he is surprisingly \" liberal \" for an Orthodox . For instance , he paints Mehmet Fatih , the Muslim conqueror of Constantinople , as a very tolerant ruler . I also wonder about his interpretation of the Church father Cyprian . Even so , \" The Orthodox Church \" remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over - view of this remarkable Christian Church .", "A great read for anyone interested in cards .

Florida .", "Janet Browne 's far - reaching biography misses little in bringing us the life of the 19th Century 's most controversial biologist / geologist .   The first volume of a two - volume set , \" Voyaging \" , begins ( as you would expect ) with his youth in the English town of Shrewsbury under his father 's care .   We meet his father - a Doctor and businessman , his brother - intelligent but unfocused , and his late grandfather Erasmus Darwin who was well known at the time for his eccentric and agnostic views .   From his early days , Browne depicts a Darwin struggling to find himself , first as a medical student in Edinburgh , then as a student of theology in Cambridge .   Though we know better what Darwin is to be , Browne 's portrait of him manages to evoke the doubt that he must have felt when faced with adequate but uninspiring career options . But the story often returns to Darwin 's love of the outdoors and of biology - a theme which underpins all of his early feints and mis - steps at life .   He is seen as a frequent hunter , and an avid collector and cataloguer of insects and beetles .   Despite this , and despite the benefit of hindsight , at times I felt some tension - finding myself unconsciously wishing to offer advice to this young man who seems adrift and unaware of the great role that history was preparing him for .   We finally catch a glimpse of that future as he fortuitously receives an offer to travel aboard The Beagle , a vessel bound for South America on a surveying mission .   I wo n't NOT_spoil NOT_the NOT_rest , NOT_other NOT_than NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_Browne NOT_does NOT_an NOT_excellent NOT_job NOT_of NOT_building NOT_Darwin , NOT_showing NOT_in NOT_detail NOT_each NOT_moment NOT_of NOT_discovery NOT_upon NOT_which NOT_the NOT_next NOT_is NOT_laid , NOT_capturing NOT_his NOT_excitement NOT_about NOT_the NOT_natural NOT_world NOT_as NOT_he NOT_slowly NOT_sheds NOT_his NOT_amateur NOT_standing NOT_and NOT_gains NOT_confidence - NOT_finally NOT_attaining NOT_acknowledged NOT_scientific NOT_stature .   And yet even then , Darwin holds his boldest work out of sight of the world , privately developing the theory of natural selection out of sight of a straightjacketed Victorian society . In tenor , it 's clear that Browne , a Professor in the History of Biology greatly respects her subject .   But she does not NOT_allow NOT_him NOT_to NOT_pass NOT_through NOT_her NOT_pen NOT_unscathed .   Darwin was a man of his times and of a certain station , and held certain prejudices that the author does n't NOT_hesitate NOT_to NOT_point out - such as his not NOT_wholly NOT_humanitarian attitudes about slavery .   She also reveals what some may find Darwin 's less endearing traits such as his anti - social tendencies and his lack of any real passion for any subject but science ( When approaching the subject of marriage , Darwin 's priority on research causes him to discard several eligible but too learned women who , he feared , might place demands on his time ) .   She does seem to soft - pedal Darwin 's poor treatment of his companions on The Beagle , many of whom contributed significantly to his efforts on that seminal voyage , and whose contributions went largely uncredited and unrecognized .   ( For those curious , this theme is well - explored in Robert Wright 's \" The Moral Animal\")Also , it was difficult for me to follow the various people who pass through his life and their relationship to him , more my failing than the author 's I think , as she provides ample details on the many individuals who made an impact on Darwin 's life .   If you do decide to read it , it might be helpful to keep a pen and paper handy for jotting down a few notes ( although the author does append a fairly extensive family tree at the front of the book).Certainly , the book is well worth reading for anyone with more than a passing interest in exactly how the theory of evolution ( and the legend of Charles Darwin ) was born .

This was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . Not NOT_only NOT_did NOT_i NOT_get NOT_to NOT_see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . The very fast - paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast - talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . Gibson 's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . Gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . The character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . Try to imagine a toned - downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover - ups . If you can imagine that , then you 've basically got jerry fletcher . In many ways , i was surprised by this movie . To begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . Do n't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong , it 's not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be NOT_accepting NOT_any NOT_gold NOT_trophies NOT_next NOT_spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . Secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson 's performance . He provided a fantastic performance . The previews of this film led me to believe it was an all - out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . Gibson 's character has an almost uncountable number of one - liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . For instance , jerry 's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . And last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . Writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher 's far - fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland 's own opinions . Mel gibson is n't NOT_the NOT_only NOT_stand - NOT_out NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film . Julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who ca n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . He also seems obsessed and in love with her . But whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . Jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . Although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . Very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . After barely NOT_escaping NOT_alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . The remainder of the film is almost always fast - paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry 's life being constantly put into jeopardy . And more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry 's life . Many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . For instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e. g. Lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . Make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . Definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . I am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action - thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . And even if you NOT_are n't , you should still like this film .", "Good Hotel - No NOT_problems .   My family stayed here May 21 - 25th . we had two triple rooms . The rooms are small . but by European standards they were big . The staff was very helpful and freindly . Breakfast was small but fine . it would have been nice to have some variation from day to day . The dining staff was very quick and freindly The rooms were clean . A C worked fine . and we had plenty of hot water . The lobby is small and they could use a faster elevator . We were on the 5th floor and could sit outside and watch the crowd walk in the street below us .   very nice after a long day of touring Rome . Perfect location We would stay there again .", "Lives up to it 's 5 stars however is an impersonal place to stay .

The first day we were in Rome it absolutely bucketed down . When we arrived back to the hotel we asked if we were able to have our clothes put in a drying room which they were more that happy to do at no NOT_cost Any extras at this hotel are very expensive such as breakfasts . room service etc It also appears very much to cater for the American business traveller who is familiar with the .

It really scared me , and i did n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_go NOT_see NOT_it . However , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it . I did n't NOT_get NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_do NOT_so , NOT_until NOT_now . The film , disney 's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron . It has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it . Then , we meet a farmer - wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran . Taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a ` pig - keeper ' ( they have a pig named hen - wen ) . One day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen 's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest . An evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location . Taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her . Along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires ` munchings and crunchings ' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) . When he hears hen wen 's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants . Taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king 's castle from far away . Taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen . He manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon . There , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls . Along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie . The three manage to escape the horned king 's castle , but not NOT_before NOT_taran realizes that his sword is magic . As they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen 's trail . He leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of ` pig tracks ' , to a whirlpool . Suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy - like fairfolk . Taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva . He then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world . With the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage . It turns out to be no NOT_ordinary NOT_cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place . When taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword . Taran agrees , much to eilonwy 's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron . But ? the cauldron ca n't NOT_be NOT_destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped . The only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive . Things take a turn for the worse when the horned king 's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle . Taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) . Just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr . Taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not NOT_wanting NOT_him NOT_to NOT_throw his life away . Gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay . Taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king . He kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely . Taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king 's castle just as it self - destructs . The witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they ` never give anything away , they bargain ' . In response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi . The trade is made ; gurgi 's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group . As taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs - he is not NOT_dead NOT_after NOT_all ! The happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return . As spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times . Before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio . Bringing this book to the screen was the studio 's fondest dream . Miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects . When micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron . By this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department . Many of the studio 's old men had retired or died . Therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film . Originally budgeted at $ 25 million , the costs raised to $ 40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped . The film was rated pg and the film , although ` disneyfied ' from lloyd alexander 's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney 's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it . In addition , other critics rejected it for having ` no NOT_heart ' and ` unmemorable ' , compared to other disney animated features . But whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $ 21 million . The failure of the film grounded the studio 's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no NOT_longer become a part of the studio 's reputation . The next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , did n't NOT_do NOT_much NOT_better ( NOT_although NOT_oliver NOT_and NOT_company NOT_grossed NOT_much NOT_more NOT_than NOT_the NOT_black NOT_cauldron NOT_and NOT_the NOT_great NOT_mouse NOT_detective ) . Only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features . As for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron . Finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released . Because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ? The people who had seen the film did n't NOT_think NOT_so . In fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it . For a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom . Few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who had n't NOT_seen NOT_the NOT_film NOT_yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat . But people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) . Somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , ` bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states . Before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs . Those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version . Even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed . Some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it was NOT_n't . But these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available . As for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i did n't NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_at NOT_all . In fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i did n't NOT_think NOT_the NOT_film NOT_would NOT_ever NOT_be NOT_such NOT_a NOT_good NOT_film . Much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , \" this is the same film everyone saw ? The one that flopped at the box office ? The one that critics and filmgoers alike called \" a bad movie \" ? This does n't NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_all NOT_of NOT_the NOT_above . Instead , it 's a classic in its own right . The film has a wonderful cast of characters . There 's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig - keeper , the story 's hero . The critics have said that taran is not NOT_likeable NOT_at NOT_all , but the opposite is true . He is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on . There 's a likeable character here ! Not NOT_that NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_the NOT_only NOT_likeable NOT_character NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film . There 's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they do n't NOT_quite NOT_hit it off at first . But another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film 's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck . The other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , are n't NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_well NOT_rounded as they should be . The story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale . Elmer bernstein 's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner . The animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios . Even though there are some occasional effects that are not NOT_quite NOT_good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch . Overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor . Fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids . There are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney 's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg . Fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie . Even though it does n't NOT_have NOT_all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given . That better chance has finally come . Whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney 's most proudest achievements . I ca n't NOT_help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?", "About the Band : Dead Can Dance is considered the seminal example of the ethereal or heavenly voices genre .   In fact , the name of the label , 4AD , which carried many of the 1990s DCD releases , is sometimes also used to describe this genre of music , which is a fusion of subtle electronics , vocals , drums , world music , and a near limitless count of instruments .   Brendan Perry sometimes has been described as a gothic Frank Sinatra .   Lisa Gerrard 's enchanting vocals are often sung in a language only known to Lisa .   I count myself among the many that hold these two musicians in the highest esteem . About the Album : Compared to more recent albums that are loaded with bonus tracks , the 50-minutes of Into the Labyrinth would seem short , if it were n't NOT_for the fact that I like to listen to this album over and over again .   I count this album as one of my all time favorites , and certainly my most prized Dead Can Dance CD.One of the nicest things about this album is that it features nearly equal amounts of both Lisa 's and Brendan 's ghostly vocals .   On some tracks they accompany each other , while others feature only one of the artist 's chilling or mystical sounding vocals .   Simply put , this is beautiful music to relax to .   I honestly give this album my highest recommendations!Two tracks I 'd recommend sampling : \" Towards the Within \" ( featuring Lisa 's vox w/ Brendan backing ) and \" Tell Me About the Forest \" ( featuring Brendan 's vox ) .   I believe they best represent the range of songs you can expect with this album .   Please note that while all the tracks feature vocals , the lyrics for only those sung in English are included in the liner notes . Similar Artists : Chances are if you are n't NOT_yet NOT_familiar with Dead Can Dance , that you 've not NOT_yet NOT_discovered NOT_some NOT_of NOT_these NOT_other NOT_bands , but I highly recommend them as well : Das Zeichen , Impressions of Winter , Love is Colder Than Death , Qntal , Corvus Corax , or Helium Vola .   There is a rather large ( and somewhat underappreciated ) range of artists still producing heavenly voices music that is similar in quality to Dead Can Dance .   Please check some of them out as well .", "In chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she 'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they 'll most enjoy . Some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not NOT_have NOT_known they had before . This can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no NOT_depth NOT_or NOT_true NOT_worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat 's true colors begin to shine through . Making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom 's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted - not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_one of the best films of the year . What gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom 's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what 's on its mind NOT_without holding back to prevent offending audiences . The bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no NOT_doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow - mindedness . Chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion . The bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non - religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth - watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens . Many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne 's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon - like alfred molina ) , who will stop at NOT_nothing to put her out of business . On the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne 's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent - koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie - ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not NOT_hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does . Also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends . Juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character 's determination to turn the narrow - minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat 's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses . Lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs . Judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin . Carrie ann - moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not NOT_previously NOT_seen , NOT_crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously . Victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always - on - the - move mother will eventually settle down . A trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : \" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . \" That 's not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_the NOT_men NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_do NOT_their NOT_share , NOT_though : NOT_alfred NOT_molina NOT_makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne . The technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film . Cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman 's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules . Chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter . While not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom 's chocolat is a film which works on all levels - as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale . And it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward . The bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure .", "This book is hot ! ! . I anxiously awaited the next \" Grayson \" novel , after reading of course , all , the \" Falcon \" and \" Grayson \" families ' stories .

Woody allen 's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand - in - hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best - looking films i 've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city 's best areas , etc . ) , a fan ca n't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_feel NOT_visibly NOT_moved . The film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane . Beethoven 's 5th blasts on the soundtrack . The city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it 's all rather lovely to look at . And then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film 's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something 's wrong with her life or whatever . It 's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or NOT_without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year 's \" deconstructing harry \" came awfully close ) . What the hell has happened to him ? The man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not NOT_become NOT_less NOT_funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \" bullets over broadway , \" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \" mighty aphrodite \" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \" everyone says i love you \" was more of a great idea than a great film . Even \" deconstructing harry \" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . If anything , the reception of \" celebrity \" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it 's not NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_and NOT_critics NOT_who NOT_are NOT_wrong NOT_about NOT_how NOT_wonderful NOT_his NOT_film NOT_is : NOT_it NOT_'s him . \" celebrity \" is , yes , a good film , but it 's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . Instead of creating the great woody allen world , he 's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . And he 's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . It 's like \" la dolce vita \" without NOT_the NOT_accuracy , NOT_the NOT_right NOT_amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . Woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not NOT_himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . Much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh 's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o ' hand gestures ) , is hardly NOT_a NOT_warts - NOT_and - NOT_all NOT_impersonation . Branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character 's flaws to be more apparent . Woody 's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he 's really funny and really witty and really intelligent . Branagh 's allen is a bit more flat - out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we 're still not NOT_sure if he 's really a good person or NOT_not . His character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him ... sorta . We then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid - life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . He has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie \" but with a deep personal crisis \" ) . As such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . After griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is \" polymorphously perverse \" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not NOT_different NOT_from that of the anita ekberg segment of \" la dolce vita . \" Following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . His story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . While lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( \" i 've become the kind of woman i 've always hated ... and I 'm loving it . \") Without doing a thing . The result is a film of highs and mediums . The mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which do n't NOT_exactly NOT_work but you ca n't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_pat NOT_allen NOT_on NOT_the NOT_back NOT_for NOT_trying . But other places are really great scenes . The opening . The sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it had n't NOT_ended . A banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . And , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot - as - hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by NOT_none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un - dicaprio - esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they 'd never look at him the same way . He ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing NOT_in NOT_showing NOT_his NOT_character NOT_as NOT_narcissistically NOT_tyrannical , NOT_and NOT_totally NOT_heartbreaking NOT_for NOT_lee , NOT_who NOT_comes NOT_to NOT_him NOT_to NOT_talk NOT_about NOT_his NOT_script NOT_that NOT_he NOT_has NOT_read , and finds himself on a wild all - day ride with him . They go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . Allen 's writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i 'd almost recommend the film . Almost . But what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it 's a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it 's still a smart and insightful film . Though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not NOT_exactly NOT_about NOT_celebrities , NOT_as NOT_it NOT_may NOT_seem to be ( if it were , it 'd be extremely out - of - touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity - hood with happiness . We never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they 're really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface ... ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis ' character . Lee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm 's length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . Besides , it 's witty , and it does have the one thing that no NOT_other NOT_film has but allen 's : that great woody allen feel . It may be not NOT_exactly NOT_fresh NOT_and NOT_lively NOT_or NOT_totally NOT_brilliant NOT_in NOT_its NOT_depiction NOT_of NOT_its NOT_subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen 's oeuvre , it 's merely a blip ( no \" NOT_annie NOT_hall \" but it 's no \" NOT_shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no NOT_one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not NOT_once but twice .", "Shakespeare . you hardly NOT_understood NOT_it NOT_in NOT_high NOT_school . Why would you want more of it now that your english grade does n't NOT_count NOT_on it ? If this is your attitude , then i 'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh 's hamlet is probably not NOT_for NOT_you , and you might as well stop reading right now . If , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open - minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . Namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has we d the king 's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . His suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother 's hands . Hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery .... and The game is afoot .... The first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . With external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . Interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . The hamlet castle 's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror - panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second - story loft . Costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination .. Not NOT_quite the denmark of the 1600 's , the characters ' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . It is not NOT_surprising NOT_that NOT_tim NOT_harvey NOT_and NOT_alexandra NOT_byrne NOT_were NOT_nominated NOT_for NOT_best NOT_art NOT_direction NOT_and NOT_best NOT_costume NOT_design NOT_oscars , NOT_respectively . In addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . As the revenge - driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . From the anticipation of seeing his father 's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . Every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh 's acting and directing as to shakespeare 's manuscript . Hamlet seems to be a who 's who of shakespearean - trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . Julie christie , as hamlet 's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . Kate winslet as hamlet 's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character 's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . Richard briers as ophelia 's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . Nicholas farrell as hamlet 's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two - timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . Hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . In some cases , this made for interesting scenes . Billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . Crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . However , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . As the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . Part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . His off - camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well - voiced actor . I wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . Unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . Jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just ca n't NOT_do NOT_shakespeare . As marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet 's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . Gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . Richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk - on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . I think he had two lines . Then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . When i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . If bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . Hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . Branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback - type images . This only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do NOT_without them . You do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be NOT_some NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_genius NOT_to NOT_appreciate NOT_shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . The alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . In it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king 's english . Or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .", "I got the pleasure of seeing Albert open for bb king .

Although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti - hero skin as his career progresses , here he explores a new genre : the businessman as action hero .

Mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom , but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation . A veteran of numerous hard - nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently . The casting is what puts this film over the top . The trio of gibson , the kidnappers ' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully . Sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark . His speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h. g. wells=92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of= Society . mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below , feeding off the unsuspecting .

Their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime - gone - wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film . The main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but did n't NOT_quite NOT_have NOT_the NOT_brains NOT_to NOT_get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who 's wise to the world , but he does n't NOT_really NOT_want NOT_to NOT_do NOT_much NOT_of NOT_anything NOT_besides NOT_go NOT_bowling , NOT_smoke NOT_pot , and generally relax . That main character is jeffrey \" the dude \" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film 's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as \" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . \" The dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline - psychotic who 's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody 's cheating in a bowling match ( \" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! \" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who 's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( \" donny , you have no NOT_frame NOT_of reference here ! \" ) . These three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of \" hotel california \" and , if it 's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter . If that does n't NOT_give NOT_you NOT_a NOT_good NOT_idea of this film 's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude 's rug . They 've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the \" big \" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) . The dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he does n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $ 1 million ransom . Unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop - off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude 's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money . Soon , the dude is being harassed not NOT_only NOT_by NOT_the NOT_big NOT_lebowski NOT_himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german \" nihilists \" who demand the ransom money even though they may not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn . Meanwhile , the big lebowski 's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant - garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family . The plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc . The previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival 's \" run through the jungle , \" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) . The film does n't NOT_feature NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_many NOT_one - NOT_liners NOT_and NOT_sight NOT_gags NOT_as NOT_the NOT_coens ' NOT_other NOT_comedies ( NOT_though NOT_there NOT_are NOT_a NOT_few NOT_hilarious NOT_moments NOT_of NOT_visual NOT_humor , NOT_particularly NOT_in NOT_the NOT_dude NOT_'s NOT_dream NOT_sequences NOT_and NOT_acid NOT_flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact . The film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not NOT_only NOT_set NOT_their NOT_characters NOT_loose NOT_in NOT_this \" NOT_jungle \" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution . There 's also a noticeable ( but not NOT_too NOT_heavy - NOT_handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his \" this aggression will not NOT_stand \" NOT_speech . The coens take aim at just about every elite l. a. subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( \" the bums will always lose ! \" Shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their \" peaceful beach community , \" and so on . By the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least \" aggression \" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on \" passive , \" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters . He also turns out to have a pretty well - functioning brain in his head , even if he does n't NOT_like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he 's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end . The coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they do n't NOT_just NOT_treat NOT_him NOT_as NOT_fodder NOT_for NOT_cheap NOT_shots NOT_either . I think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter - brained . Audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un - dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like NOT_nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first . \" it 's good knowin ' he 's out there , the dude , takin ' it easy , \" posits the narrator towards the end .

Oshii was the director of last year 's best - known japanese animated film import , _ ghost in the shell _ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent . One of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series . In its many incarnations -- graphic novels ( \" manga \" ) , two different runs of made - for - video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes -- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan . Set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus . As a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan . As the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as \" labors \" ( an interesting play on words , considering that \" robot \" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century . With the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace -- labor crime . This led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime . The patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no NOT_fault NOT_of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness . Sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life . Those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers . The story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay . This project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization . However , the threat in this case comes not NOT_from NOT_any NOT_terrorist , NOT_but NOT_from NOT_someone NOT_who NOT_is NOT_already NOT_dead ... Shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if NOT_not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors ' movement speed and efficiency by 30 % . This hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90 % of the nation 's labors ... including the patrol labors of sv2 . Since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily - armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason ... and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos . ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . ) It 's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors -- including sv2 's own -- fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father 's company down with it . As was the case with _ ghost in the shell _ , if you just want a no - NOT_brainer actionfest , this might not NOT_be NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_you . _ patlabor : the movie _ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama . It is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _ into _ action movies notwithstanding ) . There are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ ghost in the shell _ . This movie is fraught with symbolism -- in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism . Patlabor 's near - future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day . The film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ? Are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ? This is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor 's alternate-1999 setting . As far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that 's the only one i 've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so . The animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to . The oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better - suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline . As far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _ patlabor : the movie _ . I do n't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_can NOT_recall ever seeing a fish - eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ ghost in the shell _ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all . The cinematography is well - suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters ' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences . The audio track of _ patlabor : the movie _ is in glorious hi - fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems -- it _ is _ that good . Even without NOT_headphones , NOT_sounds NOT_from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _ come _ from that side . Giant robot footsteps are deep and booming . The sometimes - understated , sometimes - blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery . As far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they 're among the most easily - readable subtitles i 've ever seen for _ anything _ . Large enough that they do n't NOT_strain NOT_the NOT_eyes , but small enough not NOT_to NOT_conceal NOT_too NOT_much of the screen . Although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _ patlabor _ is foremost not NOT_an NOT_action NOT_movie . Although it is a superbly - realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people 's enjoyment . My .", "As i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film . With the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a \" great \" piece of work and viceversa . Attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs . I avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology . As the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master . As such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality . Crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category . Crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology . It is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half - gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable . All the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement . The classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two . It is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend . The elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented . The paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively . The fight scenes are stunning balletic tours - de - force , not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_taken NOT_literally NOT_but NOT_clearly NOT_to NOT_be NOT_enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake . There need be no NOT_question NOT_of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry . As in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy . Do not NOT_assume , NOT_however , NOT_that NOT_the NOT_art NOT_is NOT_limp - NOT_wristed . For those who are put off by the \" art \" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance .

He pulls up construction stakes and invents other nocturnal forays to stop development . Mullet Fingers enlists the help of his step sister , Beatrice and new kid , Roy . Beatrice is a middle - school soccer queen who holds her own with the boys . Roy is a level - headed kid who moves to Coconut Cove from Montana , earning the dubious title of Cowgirl . When you throw in a zany cop , a redneck construction boss , a sly businessman , a high school teacher willing to support kids acting for righteous causes and a bully whose attempts to squash Roy you 've got a pretty good read !", "Loved the Sofitel . I have just returned from a week at the Sofitel Roma it was incredible . I have been to Rome and throughout Italy many times and this was the best . The location was great and the rooms were large by Italy standards . The staff was very helpful . We had a wonderful time and I would stay at the Sofitel again .", "Everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with \" progress . \" Giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis . His house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no NOT_television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he 's living in the twentieth century , not NOT_the NOT_nineteenth . This is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns \" erstwhile fogy \" giles into a three - dimensional human being . Despite his tunnel vision , it 's impossible not NOT_to NOT_like NOT_the NOT_man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no NOT_one is immune : love . And , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm - hearted motion picture , it 's possible to find the object of one 's affection in the most unusual places . Giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not NOT_frequent NOT_the NOT_cinema , but when he learns that an e. m. forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go . What he does n't NOT_realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii . A nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress . Just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it 's love at first sight . Giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes . ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially does n't NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_he NOT_needs NOT_a NOT_tv NOT_to NOT_use NOT_the NOT_vcr . ) Eventually , not NOT_satisfied NOT_with being the world 's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol 's home is located . Bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie 's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) . Eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles ' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man 's advice . But , while giles ' affection runs deep , ronnie 's feelings are less constant . Love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that . In fact , for its first half , the film is nearly - perfect . It suffers a fall - off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none - NOT_too - NOT_subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it . In his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer / director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100 % on- target . In the process , he not NOT_only NOT_creates NOT_a NOT_truly NOT_likable NOT_and NOT_memorable NOT_character NOT_in NOT_giles , NOT_but NOT_says NOT_a NOT_few NOT_things NOT_about NOT_the NOT_transforming NOT_power NOT_of NOT_love , NOT_even NOT_if NOT_it NOT_is NOT_unrequited . From start to finish , this is clearly hurt 's movie ? he 's in almost every frame . It 's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever - changing facial expressions . Jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie . He is charismatic , and it 's not NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_giles NOT_is NOT_attracted NOT_to NOT_ronnie . Meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always - reliable maury chaykin . Love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture / love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a \" fish out of water \" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) . Yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots . It has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .", "Nine months ago I was hired to help turnaround a once successful business .   From day one I realized that this was a company NOT_without focus .   It 's one thing to define a problem , another to find a solution .   Haneberg 's book was a shot in the arm .   Just one concept -- \" Stop Multitasking \" -- would have been a major breakthrough for my team .   And , personally , the idea of doing \" One Great Thing \" has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job .   This book immediately rose to the rank of three or four \" must read \" titles in my business library .   In the couple of months since I first read it ( and I 've re - read it a couple of times ) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions -- we 're nailing deadlines , we 're closing more sales , we 're thinking more strategically across the board .   In a business and social environment that throws more at us day - by - day , hour - by - hour , this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago .   We 're all doing more with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities .   If it 's true , as Woody Allen says , that 98 % of success is showing up , then the other 2 % is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there .   This is the manual for getting your business -- and your life -- where you want it to be", "Plot : jet li is a chinese cop asked to help some french policemen nab a bad guy . But one thing leads to another , and the next thing you know , li 's being chased by the same french cops with whom he was supposed to be working . A lot of ass - kicking , face - whippings , gun fights and ... okay , a little more ass - kicking ensues . Critique : very cool ! Now here 's a movie that gives you exactly what you 're looking for , if what you 're looking for is kickass action , a palpable good cop / bad cop story line , some hardcore stunts and jet li slam - dunking everyone in sight ! The film also moves fast ( a mere 95 minutes ) , develops a certain \" cute \" chemistry between fonda and li , has nice surroundings ( paris , baby ! ) and gives us one of the best bad guys that i 've seen all year . Tcheky karyo is the devil incarnate in this film . He is pure evil . They should have called this movie bad lieutenant 2 as keitel NOT_has nothing on this man . What a great , great monster ! My favorite line of tcheky 's was when li was explaining the whole \" kiss of the dragon \" thing to him and he cut him off by saying \" kiss my ass ! \" Pure action movie poetry . Anyway , other than him , jet li also handled his \" acting \" pretty well in this film , with very little real dialogue to say , but enough to make us believe his character . Actually , just looking into the man 's eyes generally tells you a lot . Fonda was also pretty good , despite playing one of the most trashy and abused women that i have seen in quite some time , but i still felt kinda bad for her , so i guess she did her job okay . But in the end , nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances . We go to see jet li movies because we want to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side to side , and this film delivers gangbusters on that front . And yes ... they have no NOT_wire - NOT_fu NOT_in this movie ... i Say again ... no NOT_Wire - NOT_work , NOT_no NOT_bullshit NOT_stunts NOT_with NOT_li NOT_floating around in mid - air for over a minute . It 's all straight action , fist to fist , boot to face and all around cool stunts . If that 's what you 're looking for , i do n't see how you will be disappointed with this film . Yes , it 's not very original in plot ( just take luc besson 's own la femme nikita and mix in plenty of his own the professional et voila ! ) , does have an annoying hip - hoppy soundtrack that just got on my nerves after a while ( i also would have gotten rid of the whole acupuncture thang ... ) and will have anyone not willing to restrain their disbelief , rolling their eyes all over the place . But was i entertained ? Thoroughly . Does the film feature more gunplay , martial arts and over - the - top kills that most recent action flicks ? Yes , again . Does this sound interesting to you ? Well , the answer to that question is entirely up to you . One thing that i would definitely recommend is , as jet li pointed out himself on his website , that you leave the kids at home for this one . In fact , you might even wanna leave yourself if you ca n't handle the more violent of sequences . All in all , a rippin ' , roarin ' fun time ! Where 's joblo coming from ?

The novel was a summer smash , topping best - seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads . The only problem : the novel was n't NOT_very NOT_good . It was far more pulp than pulitzer . But the director realized that , no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_pedestrian NOT_the NOT_prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_writer , was a fantastic storyteller . So he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen . The director ? Francis ford coppola . The book , of course , was mario puzo 's the godfather . The rest , as they say in showbiz , was history . By bringing up the godfather , i do n't NOT_mean NOT_to NOT_suggest NOT_that NOT_robert NOT_altman NOT_'s NOT_the NOT_gingerbread NOT_man NOT_is NOT_destined NOT_for NOT_that NOT_level NOT_of NOT_greatness . But the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material . Can you get any more questionable than john grisham ? Depends on whom you ask . But there 's no NOT_question NOT_that NOT_grisham NOT_'s NOT_work NOT_grabs NOT_people . Like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who ca n't NOT_tell NOT_a NOT_well - NOT_constructed NOT_story NOT_from a can of spam . So something in grisham 's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america 's greatest living filmmakers . The result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon . > from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe . This terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch . Witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear . We roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone . Right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises . Pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not NOT_conceived NOT_by NOT_john NOT_grisham , NOT_but NOT_by NOT_altman . This is what a great director can do for questionable source material . The sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases . Magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office . Outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen . Driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home . There he learns more about mallory 's life than he bargained for . Her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski - style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter . Magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory 's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course . This simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end . He succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well . But then dixon 's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger . The cops wo n't NOT_lift NOT_a NOT_finger NOT_to NOT_help NOT_a NOT_liberal NOT_attorney . His only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private - eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) . If this predicament was n't NOT_bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos . Altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh 's performance holds the gingerbread man together . An accomplished actor when he is n't NOT_directing NOT_himself NOT_in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives . Is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ? Magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it 's too late . As the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none NOT_of NOT_us NOT_are NOT_as NOT_secure as we think we are . And life is never so bad that it ca n't NOT_get NOT_worse . If you 're familiar with altman 's work , you 'll recognize several of his signature techniques . Characters are not NOT_introduced NOT_in NOT_establishing NOT_shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent . Crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action . Dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style . And of course there 's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot . Thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i 've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand . And now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether . The naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film . Is it old - school sexism , or a clever in - joke ? You be the judge . But back to the picture at hand . In the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no NOT_better NOT_or NOT_worse NOT_than the countless others we 've all endured . In the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese 's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result . What may prevent it from enduring with altman 's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no NOT_third NOT_act NOT_in grisham 's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up . But there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through . That polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are . They probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill . And that , my friends , should make you very afraid .", "For anybody , who wish to learn about the Orthodox Church , and Christianity in general for that matter , this book is \" must - read \" .", "Recommend .

Roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film . I read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it . The opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter . The landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) . One can almost sense the cold . But the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better . This is probably not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_would NOT_have NOT_been NOT_improved NOT_by NOT_lots NOT_of NOT_odd NOT_shots . The movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true . This chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed . In the plane three men find ? the american dream ... In a gym bag . ? Affliction too was set in a snowy landscape . It really seems very simple . Just hold on to the money until spring , and if no NOT_one claims it , they 'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true . But the snow melts , and so might several of the character 's hopes . As in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing . But doing the right thing might not NOT_result NOT_in NOT_a NOT_better NOT_result NOT_than NOT_something NOT_more NOT_selfish . The movie 's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense . I have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger . The biggest problem seems to over - familiarization with the story . The writer perhaps feels that he does n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not NOT_read the book . This is definitely not NOT_the NOT_problem NOT_with NOT_a NOT_simple NOT_plan , NOT_even NOT_though NOT_the NOT_screenplay NOT_is NOT_by NOT_the NOT_book NOT_'s NOT_author . The movie is always clear on where it 's going , and always makes sense . I 'm sue a lot was cut , but really i ca n't NOT_remember NOT_what .

I do n't NOT_understand NOT_it NOT_myself , but that 's what the bond series is based on . For ( i think ) 18 films , we 've mostly got the same thing over and over again , with some variation ( and a bit of change , most notably in the two dalton films ) . But even i , a king of cynicism , ca n't NOT_bitch NOT_about NOT_it . And \" tomorrow never dies , \" the ( again , i think ) eighteenth bond film , and second brosnan bond film , is no NOT_exception . Thank god ! The plot , as in most of them , is pure balderdash , but seems to have a nice kind of edge to it . Instead of just plain billionaire psychotics , we get a rupert murdoch - esque media mogul / psychotic - elliot carver ( jonathan pryce , looking bitching with a white - haired cru cut , and always talking like he 's out of breath ) , who has the admittingly ingenius idea of getting ratings by creating a war . No , NOT_this NOT_is NOT_not \" NOT_wag the dog \" - he wants a real war , between china and england , and is stupid enough to put the coverage out before anyone else discovered it ... in Comes bond . James is sent all around the world , trying to do research on carver , fighting with his men , and running into ( on more than one occasion ) a chinese secret agent like him : wai lin ( michelle yeoh , asian action star extraordinaire ... and Co - star of \" supercop , \" nearly stealing the screen from jackie chan in that one ) . The two eventually , and predictably of course , begin working together , and yes , there is some sexual tension between the two . Luckily , their relationship is never strained , and she never gives into his cassanova - ness until the finale . Thank god again . In every bond film , james bags , on average , three women ( sometimes more , sometimes less - the latter being more potent towards the aids - cautionary dalton ) , and he does n't NOT_spoil NOT_this NOT_one ( NOT_though NOT_we NOT_never NOT_see NOT_them , NOT_of NOT_course - NOT_i NOT_mean , NOT_they NOT_need NOT_to NOT_stay NOT_around NOT_a NOT_pg-13 NOT_rating ) . There 's always one at the beginning with some chick we never see again , the big bond girl ( yeoh ) , and this time we have an almost - cameo by teri hatcher as carver 's wife , paris , who , it seems , was once one of the girls he bags at the beginning . Yes , teri 's very attractive , but she seems kind of dull . Of course , it 's not NOT_really NOT_her NOT_fault ; her part is under - written , and she 's only in a small part of it . Oh well . And there are always the big henchmen , the guys who do the dirty work for the polished big villains . This time we get a tall , arian - looking ( not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_robert NOT_shaw in \" from russia with love \" -looking ) guy named stamper ( goetz otto ) , who is pretty awesome , although a bit stiff ( well , mostly his posture , really ) . And for a bit of comedy , we get a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who is ordered to do in bond at one point . The government people have small parts , as usual , with q ( desmond llewelyn , looking near death , sadly ) getting only one scene ( in a more grouchy mood than usual ) , and m ( judi dench ) , getting more than m usually gets ( i mean , it is judi dench ) . And for no NOT_reason NOT_whatsoever , except 'cause he was so good in \" goldeneye , \" joe don baker shows up again as wade , admitting he has no NOT_reason NOT_for being there , and is this time more annoying . Again , oh well . The action sequences are not NOT_a NOT_let - NOT_down , NOT_although NOT_sometimes NOT_go NOT_on NOT_too NOT_long . They pop up every now and then , mainly because they have to ( for the sake of the series ) , and some significant ones are the opening one , one in a garage with a bmw that runs on remote control , and a motorcylce chase ( on a bmw cycle , nonetheless ) through china streets ( or was it vietnam ... the Plot 's not NOT_really NOT_essential ) . They 're more high - tech , and feature much more laughs , which , yeah , i dig . So what if they 're distracting ; they 're supposed to be ! The acting , from most around is great . Yeoh is , actually , one of the better bond girls , mainly because she 's so unique . The better bond girls are more independent , and have a certain wily - ness to them . Pussy galore , with her homoerotic undertones and all , is one of the best , and diana rigg , who married bond at the end of \" on her majesty 's secret service \" only to be killed , added some emotional depth . Yeoh is notable since she 's so active , and has great chemistry with brosnan . Pryce is an awesome villain , being slimy and lovable at the same time . And brosnan is , once again , the mack daddy . The bond series is built on cliches , mainly because they 're so fun and add to the escapism . If you can remember the dalton years , and they 're serious direction , you remember how unsuccessful they were , both financially and aesthetically . The series would falter if bogged down with too much plot , too many themes , and too much characterization . I do n't NOT_really NOT_understand NOT_it NOT_myself , NOT_yet NOT_i NOT_'m one of the bigger fans of the series in the northeast united states .

After hundreds of years , we 've finally figured that one out . This almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg 's latest \" serious \" film . During the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa 's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . Fifty - three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . Freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . After killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . Instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . The amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . The legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . If they are property , who do they belong to ? Their masters ? The spanish government ? Salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? The us government ? The defendants are pawns in several games . Abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . Their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . South carolina senator john c. calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . President martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . When the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . Even that does n't NOT_work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . At the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave - owners . This little - known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america 's past would have gone down a darker path were it not NOT_for NOT_former NOT_president NOT_john NOT_quincy NOT_adams ( NOT_anthony NOT_hopkins ) NOT_who NOT_is NOT_persuaded NOT_to NOT_argue NOT_the NOT_case NOT_before NOT_the NOT_supreme NOT_court . The slavery issue is easy pickin 's for spielberg . Much like his \" shindler 's list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not NOT_difficult NOT_ones NOT_to NOT_choose . Nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . It 's not NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_see NOT_who NOT_the NOT_bad NOT_guys NOT_are . Without NOT_that NOT_question NOT_to NOT_ponder , NOT_the NOT_director NOT_'s NOT_job NOT_is NOT_more NOT_difficult . He has to make the story interesting . Spielberg succeeds for the most part . The visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . Where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . There are very few _ people _ in the tale . In fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . Tappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not NOT_humans . Van buren is a weak politician but nothing else . The rest of the \" slaves \" barely NOT_exist NOT_other NOT_than NOT_dressing NOT_for NOT_the NOT_set . Like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . The film 's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . The former model 's first major role is a winner . Without NOT_speaking NOT_more NOT_than NOT_five NOT_words NOT_of NOT_english , NOT_he NOT_conveys NOT_more NOT_emotion NOT_than NOT_most NOT_actors NOT_with NOT_a NOT_thousand NOT_lines NOT_of NOT_dialog . The other stand - out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . The impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court - room drama ever on the screen . There are some other great moments . Especially impressive are the african 's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . Their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . As grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . More humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four - star film .

Films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker 's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio . The advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films . The dvd release of the original international version of luc besson 's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director 's cut . For years , i have heard of an \" international \" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years . I even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors ' cuts - including l ? on . But after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it . Until now . The film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello . He lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year - old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops . One day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over - the - top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries . Taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life . Mathilda learns of l ? on 's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on 's footsteps as a \" cleaner . \" She then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession . At this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in . The international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed \" too explicit . \" I assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle . The best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda 's and l ? on 's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops . There 's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean - hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson 's la femme nikita , and killing zoe . With these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda 's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version . The most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film . The film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema . My advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece .

I still think that it does n't NOT_deserve NOT_being the number 13 in the american film institute 's list of the 100 greatest american movies . And i think that lumet 's \" 12 angry men \" , wilder 's \" witness for the prosecution \" and kubrick 's \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 . But i ca n't NOT_deny NOT_the NOT_importance NOT_of \" NOT_the NOT_bridge NOT_on NOT_the NOT_river NOT_kwai \" - NOT_cinematically NOT_and NOT_in NOT_its NOT_contents . The film is set in burma in 1943 . A bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . But the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers need n't NOT_work as simple workmen . Struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . Afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . He considers it an opportunity to raise his men 's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . But the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) ... A flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . They are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . And the film does n't NOT_consistently NOT_question NOT_the NOT_military NOT_spirit NOT_as NOT_kubrick NOT_does NOT_in \" NOT_paths NOT_of NOT_glory \" . Lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . This is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . In this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film . The audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson 's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or NOT_not . The spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . ( the plot by - passes these risks . ) That means , the picture is n't NOT_perfect . But it has a lot of virtues as well . It shows the \" madness \" of war and what war can produce in people 's minds . It shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . And \" the bridge on the river kwai \" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . These points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti - war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . David lean 's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not NOT_wholly NOT_plausible ) showdown . Alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . The other actors deliver very good performances as well . Jack hildyard 's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful . I like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

Ulee 's gold feels like another fonda creation- on golden pond : it has a soft , calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath , the cinematography creates a place of gold , yellow , and olive colors , the music is stirring and tranquil . Both deal with the hardships of family life . Peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ? ez 's new film and patricia richardson ( home improvement star ) shows she is worthy of big screen attention . Nu ? ez is probably independent film 's greatest asset , along with john sayles , and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating , heavy tension . Peter fonda 's performance borrows from his father henry fonda 's in on golden pond- there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father , peter fonda is quiet , emotional , and weary in this exceptional role . Ulee jackson , the film 's protagonist , is struggling . Pressure is mounting at the wrong time . He is a beekeeper and this is his \" busy \" season . He has to deal with his two granddaughters ' needs and erupting hormones , he is forced to pick up his daughter - in - law in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her , and he is faced with a challenging task : unsettled business his son , who is now in prison , has left behind . He finds his daughter - in - law , helen , with the two men his son robbed a bank with . She has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband . That is why he got caught- the police found him with the money . Now the two men are demanding they get the cash , or they will come after ulee 's two granddaughters . Ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt . Ulee is a man who lost his pals in war- he was the only man in his platoon to survive . He refuses help from anybody and does not NOT_respond NOT_to NOT_affectionate gestures . He is a bitter , closed - off man whose only passion is his beekeeping , his granddaughters , and his dead wife . Connie , his next door neighbor , finally gets through to him with friendly favors . She is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs . Ulee 's gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is- until the truth is revealed painfully to him : he is cold and unfeeling . Of course , in the end , ulee softens up , but his journey is absorbing and we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness . What is admirable about the movie is peter fonda 's winning turn as ulee and the story that feels like nobody 's fool but , in the end , ends up in a class of its own .", "Finally a plan that works !

It is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . Dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high - cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . The director , marshall herskovitz , does n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_follow NOT_the NOT_dark NOT_and NOT_dangerous NOT_trail NOT_this NOT_story NOT_could NOT_lead NOT_down , NOT_so NOT_he NOT_opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . The film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . At this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east - west commerce . The film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . However , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . The story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . Unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not NOT_view NOT_marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders could n't NOT_get NOT_in . Veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . After a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he can not NOT_marry NOT_her . However , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco 's world , albeit not NOT_as NOT_his NOT_wife . She decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well - educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . A courtesan was not NOT_a NOT_mere NOT_prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . At one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . Veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . Once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . She is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . Their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco 's advances . In many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \" love the love , not NOT_the NOT_man , \" as her mother told her . \" dangerous beauty , \" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . It has multiple plot lines -- including veronica 's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france 's military assistance in venice 's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . Much of the film 's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . Known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson 's ire in \" braveheart \" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . She has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . The rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in \" dark city \" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . He has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . Oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . Platt is a good actor , but he 's just too hard to hate . Jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco 's uncle . \" dangerous beauty \" is marshall herskovitz 's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film \" jack the bear . \" Partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( \" thirtysomething , \" \" my so - called life \" ) and in the movies ( \" legends of the fall \" ) . His directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no NOT_discernible NOT_flourish NOT_or NOT_particular NOT_distinctions . He could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \" dangerous beauty \" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_that NOT_it NOT_seems exploitative . Herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly - stylized thriller \" kalifornia \" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara 's dark sci - fi film \" body snatchers \" ( 1994 ) . Bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth - century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . However , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( \" brazil , \" \" the princess bride \" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( \" the age of innocence \" ) . The only problem with \" dangerous beauty \" is that it does n't NOT_stick NOT_with you . It 's a good story well - told with interesting characters , but it 's easy to shrug off once you 've left the theater . The only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it 's simply too melodramatic and conventional . Herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no NOT_real NOT_weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .", "Great Hotel .

We stayed for 6 nights commencing on 29th October 2007 and found the hotel faultless . The superior double room was spacious and there was considerable attention to detail .

Ron Sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth . In Just Generosity , Sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in America . And it is a compelling vision . Sider 's vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society 's structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals . Both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty .   Drawing upon biblical study , Sider presents the goal of an economy of justice : \" Every person or family has access to productive resources ( land , money , knowledge ) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community \" ( 81 ) . Sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare , minimum wage , tax credits , health care , and education reform , showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work , empower the poor , and strengthen families . Sider ends with this troubling question : Do enough Christians really care ? This book should be required reading for any that do .", "Since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . Now , instead of emphasizing feel - good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . This realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993 's schindler 's list shows . Most of today 's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . That 's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . The movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950 's company town of coalwood , west virginia . It 's a well - known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . The mine , which is run by homer 's father ( chris cooper ) , is not NOT_the NOT_place NOT_for NOT_homer , NOT_however . After watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" Drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . With the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . October sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . Johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well - known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he 's doing here . He molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . He does not NOT_push NOT_any NOT_barriers , NOT_but NOT_instead NOT_adopts NOT_a NOT_conservative NOT_style NOT_of NOT_filmmaking NOT_which NOT_enhances NOT_the NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_charm . His finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer 's mother and father . The cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . Laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . Her role is instantly likeable . Chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer 's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . He 's definitely a driving force in homer 's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . The script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys ' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . There are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . It highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . October sky should be a success with audiences . Although it does n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_appeal NOT_of NOT_current NOT_teen NOT_flicks NOT_like NOT_varsity NOT_blues NOT_or NOT_she NOT_'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . It 's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .", "This is an excellent book . Unlike many other tutorials available on internet , it gets you started with some beautiful melodies instead of \" twinkle , twinkle , little star \" . Highly recommended !", "This book provides a fine introduction to the myths of Northern Europe .   The book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose , written by Christian writers after the fact - the Eddas , Beowulf , and the Viking sagas .   From these sources , especially the Edda , the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the Norse gods and their subsequent twilight in Ragnarok .   Then , the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the Northern European peoples .   The figures of Odin , Thor , Loki , Balder , and the rest of the Norse gods play an important part in our European cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here .   Whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of Ragnarok ( the Twilight of the Gods ) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race , as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature .   Ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the Christian worldview .   Whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by Christianity and whether or not NOT_the NOT_pagan NOT_beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried , you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand Northern Europe in pre - Christian times .   Finally , it must be noted that in many ways , at least in my opinion , the society of the Vikings was superior to our own .   I admire the strong sense of individualism that the Vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats", "Unless you frequented jazz clubs in Baltimore or Philly in the fall of 1955 , this would have been your first exposure to the Miles Davis - John Coltrane collaboration ( a few tracks recorded for Columbia , the label Miles would soon be joining exclusively , a few weeks before this session were n't NOT_issued NOT_until much later ) . Davis settled on Coltrane as his replacement for the departing Sonny Rollins almost by default - no NOT_one NOT_else fit the bill or new the book . That they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much ( Davis was a hands - off leader , Coltrane wanted constant   input from Miles on his playing and music in general ) . STABLEMATES ( a Benny Golson tune ) is the track that seems to draw the most attention . It 's an excellent composition , and although Coltrane sounds somewhat tentative ( nervous ? ) , the performance is attractive . But my favorite side is THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE , even though Coltrane sits this one out : Miles plays beautifully , and I love the emotion he wrings from the tune . True , this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz , but it 's a very good session nonetheless . The group plays well , the rhythm section is rock solid , and they are all off and running . Full speed ahead", "This work will be regarded as a classic .   It is the best work to date on   the First Crusade", "Small but beautifully marked .   Just returned from a 3 night break in Rome in mid - March .

But it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie . The new \" m \" is a woman ) . \" tomorrow never dies \" is the picture \" goldeneye \" should have been ; it 's also the most entertaining bond outing since \" the spy who loved me \" . The new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine . As an attack occurs , the front - page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media . Carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars ' german scientist from \" dr . Strangelove \" ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) . It 's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi - purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women . Enter michelle yeoh , fresh from \" supercop \" , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero . They make a great team . \" tomorrow never dies \" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is NOT_none other than the director of \" turner & hooch \" . Spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in \" goldeneye \" . Moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language . Returned in brosnan 's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv 's \" remington steele \" , as has his deadpan wit . And though carver 's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that \" genius is insanity with some success \" , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain . In the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures . There a few too many explosions in \" tomorrow never dies \" , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue . And it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , NOT_none of which i will reveal here . As it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i 'm not NOT_taking NOT_about NOT_implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed . Now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies ... It 's time to put them to use in something truly special . There 's no NOT_mistaking , however , that \" tomorrow never dies \" is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you 'll walk out wanting more bond movies . -reviewed december 17 , 1997", "Very happy with our choice .

Highly recommended", "Capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . To end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . The somewhat religious interpretation may not NOT_be NOT_to NOT_everyone NOT_'s NOT_taste . , +3 ( -4 to +4 ) More than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not NOT_letting NOT_any NOT_other NOT_consideration NOT_get in their way . This may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . During world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . This led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . When the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . Minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . While the germans , not NOT_known NOT_for NOT_their NOT_kindness NOT_in those days , had a 6 % mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27 % . The best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . That railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . The best thing for the effort was not NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_much NOT_food NOT_on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . And just being in the jungle NOT_without proper medical aid took its toll . In the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . Filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . There are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . Certainly there was david lean 's the bridge on the river kwai . There were some low - budget british exploitation films and that was about it . Then there were tv series \" a town like alice \" and \" tenko . \" Lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . It is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . The film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . The story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . It turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . Beating and torture are commonplace events . Men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not NOT_last NOT_long NOT_with NOT_parasites NOT_and NOT_disease NOT_almost NOT_inevitable . However , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . So goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail - laying machine . This is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . The japanese believe that the individual is nothing , NOT_that NOT_conformity NOT_to NOT_group NOT_'s NOT_norms NOT_is all that gives a life meaning . Conformity is purpose . Before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . If this story showed NOT_nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . If the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . It is neither . It is a stirring and believable account of camp life . The color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . This serves a double purpose for cunningham . It gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . It also creates a distancing effect . The only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . This is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . I rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .", "On a recommendation from a friend , Heimgest , DCG - OR , ( who rarely recommends any book ) , we found this book to be one of the absolute best on the subject of our Gods & amp ; Goddesses .

People are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future . After a sort of confusing bit involving fake - looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds . The basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth . The things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element . The plot in this movie really is n't NOT_that NOT_important NOT_to NOT_the NOT_thing NOT_though . This movie has very good special effects , for the most part . The techno - ish music in the background fits the mood very well . Bruce willis is an illegal taxi - cab driver in a futuristic new york city . One day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk . This movie is about what happens . The plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations . Also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end . Some characters are just plain strange including a highly - energetic deejay in drag . Bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does . The movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down . It is one of those sci - fi films where you 'll be saying \" cool \" followed by a \" what the hell ? ! ? ! \" . I give the fifth element .", "From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy , Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable .

There is an overarching galactic united nations - type organization called the senate presided by a weak chancellor . Within the senate two camps are at odds : a bickering , isolationist alliance called the republic and their aggressive rival the trade federation . Preserving law and order are a council of jedi knights who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth . Manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous , reemerging clan called the dark lords of sith , so shadowy and secretive that they comprise a \" phantom \" menace . Jedi knight qui - gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and his apprentice obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) witness an invasion of teenage queen amidala 's home planet naboo and befriend a gungan named jar jar ( ahmed best ) . On the desert planet of tatooine the two jedi , jar jar , and amidala ( natalie portman ) attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) . The five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing naboo by visiting the city planet of coruscant where a lot of debate and political maneuvering takes place . Can they free amidala 's helpless planet ? Opinion : on tv last night i watched young , wannabe celebs pay $ 400 a ticket and come running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras , gushing with testimonials of the phantom menace 's greatness in exchange for a few seconds of being on national television . Given this kind of media mania i wondered if phantom menace , the most anticipated movie of 1999 , could possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it . Does phantom menace match the exaggerated hype ? Director george lucas answers , \" it 's only a movie . \" To me , any movie with russian - sounding accents for bad guys , jamaican accents for good guys , and middle eastern - sounding accents for seedy gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound . Visually , star wars : episode i --the phantom menace ( 1999 ) is a kid show where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child - friendly cgi characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue ( mostly geopolitics ) is beyond the level of children . It is left to parents to patiently explain the conversation : droid origins , family lineage , the definitions of terms like blockade , appeasement , federation , alliance , symbiosis , satellite - controlled robots et cetera . At least this much is clear : there 's plenty of eye candy , and in the last few minutes it 's good guys and joe camel lookalikes versus a caped , horned red devil character and his mechanical hordes . Weaknesses : weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance . At first it seems like the film is to be an invasion story , but then phantom takes an hour - long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion theme . This dilutes the central story . Additionally , smaller scenes seem written self consciously , as if they were added more to fill us in on extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an integral part of the present movie . Veteran actors liam neeson and ewan mcgregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads . Better ensemble chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central to a tight story line could have made have given phantom stronger performances and storytelling punch . Strengths : on the bright side phantom menace as a big - budget production is far ahead of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures , worlds and vehicles appear real . The film boasts sophisticated , top - of - the - line visuals and quality exotic costumes , a musical score entertaining enough to stand alone , and three worthwhile sequences in the second half . Bottom line ? Seeing the film is entertaining and informative , like a visual theme park with star wars filler information serving as dialogue between impressive money shots . We are bound to be completely inundated by star wars publicity , music and tie - ins for the next few months .", "Lovely Hotel . Quiet Area . Our Room . . .

Our room was quite large at least 500 . sq . ft and even included a separate dressing room where you can hang your clothes and keep your suitcases out of sight . which I loved .

Another tip- plan to hit the Vatican Museum around 1 pm to 2 pm when the lines vanish . in the morning they stretch out to the plaza in front of St Peters . but if you wait until after 1 pm you can walk right in .

In the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year - old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year - old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year - old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year 's stay , with the self - absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not NOT_officially NOT_married NOT_to NOT_him ) NOT_and NOT_her NOT_cold NOT_one - NOT_room NOT_london NOT_flat , NOT_and NOT_is NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_the NOT_eternal NOT_truth NOT_in NOT_the NOT_sunny NOT_climate NOT_of NOT_marrakech . At least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers . She has not NOT_planned NOT_things NOT_out NOT_too NOT_carefully , NOT_having NOT_no NOT_money , and the trip does n't seem like it 's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in . Drugs , a world - wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the ' good life ' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there . But this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here . In this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off - handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken . Even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from . The film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud 's grand - daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister . It is written by the director 's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie . The title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls . With julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) . He becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls . The girls readily accept him , and there is no big - to - do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really do n't know what to make of the relationship . It especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother 's loose attitude and wants to go home . Things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village . It seems only that bilal 's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there . This scene did n't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also . But i doubt that . The family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel . Lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a ' normal ' girl . The beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets . Kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop - out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose . The background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film . The only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves . The family 's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her . That marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts . It will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence . He is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him . The new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she could n't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god . The film 's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia . The storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby - boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by . Her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best . She perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she would n't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey . After all , the mystical trip is the journey . The film 's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings . Bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity . The little girls are precocious but they are lovable . Julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but does n't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them . She was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she 's at . This is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being . And , after all is said and done , who 's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !", "True faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head - on , which is probably why so few of them do it . Even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . So it 's not NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_see NOT_why NOT_it NOT_took NOT_robert NOT_duvall NOT_fifteen NOT_years NOT_to NOT_get \" NOT_the NOT_apostle \" NOT_onto NOT_the NOT_big - NOT_screen . As a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $ 5 million of his own money . He also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . Few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single - handedly , and it 's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . And , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on - screen into power and honest emotion . Sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . He spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . Unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not NOT_a NOT_phony NOT_or NOT_a NOT_swindler , NOT_and NOT_the NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_purpose NOT_is NOT_not NOT_to NOT_unearth NOT_hypocrisy NOT_and NOT_sin NOT_in NOT_either NOT_sonny NOT_or NOT_the NOT_church . Duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . One of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long - suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . Faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . At his son 's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife 's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . Not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . He throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . In the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . After befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town 's ex - minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . Re - christening himself as \" the apostle e. f. , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other 's lives . But , always , sonny 's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . Duvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . In a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers ... But what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" The strength of duvall 's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he 's being sincere with the subject matter . After fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . His sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \" i 've always called you jesus and you 've always called me sonny , \" he says . When neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny 's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there 's no sense trying to interrupt him . The main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . Sonny 's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . However , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . In his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . And , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . It is that strength in sonny 's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . Weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . Watching duvall on - screen , it 's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . As sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . Because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . As a director , duvall feels that less is more . His camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . There are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close - ups . Duvall knew that the power of the film 's characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non - professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) did n't need to be artificially enhanced . In this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality .", "Jonathan Glover 's book is not NOT_quite NOT_like NOT_anything NOT_you NOT_'ve NOT_read NOT_on NOT_war , NOT_state NOT_terror , NOT_and NOT_genocide .   The tour of twentieth - century horrors is thematic rather than chronological , organized according to the ethical issues Glover wants to explore .   This takes a little getting used to , but it allows the author to jump , for example , from the First World War to the Cuban Missile Crisis , to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future .   The cumulative power of Glover 's pointillist technique is enormous .   & quot;Humanity&quot ; combines a clear - eyed ( necessarily often gruesome ) depiction of * in*humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better .   As an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide , it marks an advance on Ervin Staub 's classic & quot;Roots of Evil,&quot ; and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics", "This truly excellent collection of Singer 's stories ( all originally composed in the Yiddish language ) are as colorful as the people about whom the stories were written . Here are tales of weddings , of jokesters , of happy occasions of all variety , of feuding farmwives , and of unrepentant fools . After reading through a handful of Singer 's works , a person gets the feeling of how it must have been to live as a Jew in eastern Europe a hundred years ago . This was a culture rich in its traditions and lore , a people who loved life and kept their identity through good times and bad .

He focuses primarily on the Catholic church .   From Dulles ' analysis , there are five basic ways to understand the church .   He explores how these models have been used over time , as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses .   In the rest of the book , Dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology .   He has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five .   My only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward .   Rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not NOT_somehow NOT_combine NOT_several NOT_models .   The book is helpful , however , to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church .

The time and attention I did n't NOT_have for the print version came easily for the audio recording . Guiness is an engaging and enthusisatic speaker in full command of his subject matter . He draws on foundational Christian truths , historic and contemporary references , anecdotes , and a solid business acumen . He routinely distinguishes between what something is and is not ( NOT_eg ; NOT_vocation , NOT_calling , NOT_surrender ) NOT_in unequivocal terms . Also , he consistently makes the point that the main reason for our existence is to glorify God ; everything else in his presentation simply ties - back to this truth . He explains how we get distracted , how others have , and how we can correct our path , again providing examples . And unlike the Christianity Lite trend in America that often promotes wealth NOT_without work or responsibility , Guinness is explicit about the sacrifice inherent in a Christian life , using for example the lives of Leonidas , St. Francis , and Bonhoeffer . He also speaks of the joys of a truly God - centered life . I recommend THE CALL to anyone who is listening for their own call . It will help you distinguish between a calling and wish - fulfillment / fantasy , acquaint you with others who have heard their call , and inspire you to act . If you 've already heard and responded to your call , you 'll recognize Guinness as a fellow traveler . This 3-hour presentation was taped live at Highland Park Presbyterian Church in Dallas , Tx USA . The recording includes 3   audience Q&A sessions of about 10 minutes each .

Who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon , the transsexual quarterback of \" the world according to garp , \" or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in \" the hotel new hampshire \" ? A lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of \" the cider house rules , \" an adaptation of irving 's poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells . Among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role ; the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure , dr . wilbur larch , the ether - addicted head obstetrician of the st . cloud 's orphanage , maine ; and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses . Then there are the brethren who populate the apple orchard where homer wells finds himself shortly after leaving st . cloud 's , including delroy lindo , oscar ? -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them . There 's kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house , and charlize theron as candy , the lovely , lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot ( paul rudd ) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells , a man who 's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster .

All lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick . The difference is , it 's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon 's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it 's damn hard to sit and eat reese 's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield . And believe me , there 's plenty of it . A 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire . Lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted . Cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties . One woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today . I guess it 's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home . That way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan . One good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it 's a mission designed to make the army look good . They question the worth of risking eight soldiers ' lives to save one , and hanks ' character admits he does n't NOT_give NOT_a NOT_damn NOT_about ryan ; he 's just following orders . If this was a john wayne movie , things would be different . There 'd be a phony , \" let 's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! \" Attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war . By doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has . It makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone - driven stallone movie mission . The movie 's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi - introspective conversation among the soldiers . Hanks is painted first as a nails - tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men . It 's not NOT_that NOT_way NOT_for NOT_long . Edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck is n't NOT_available , is the impulsive one . Jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on . None NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_are NOT_fascinating NOT_or NOT_natural NOT_born NOT_heroes , NOT_but NOT_was NOT_spielberg NOT_'s NOT_obvious NOT_intention . I wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours ' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ? There are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson 's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after \" ink \" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it 's the wrong ryan . And of course the movie 's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck is n't NOT_available ) . That 's when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before . Saving private ryan is worth your time , but it 's definitely no NOT_schindler NOT_'s list . The battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion are n't . The movie 's bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , \" tell me i 've led a good life . Tell me i 'm a good man . \" Spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three - hour movie about the past should be framed by a self - contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present . Much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks ' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they 're doing by pretending they 're playing poker . This while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags . By not NOT_explicitly NOT_pointing NOT_out NOT_that NOT_it NOT_symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message . And even if it NOT_'s not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there .", "We have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate Computing Engineering and Systems program ( University of los Andes , Colombia ) . There are a lot of advantages using this approach instead of the classical one ( e.g. , people really learn to prove and learn to write correct proofs ) . However , to grasp these ideas you have to be patient and open minded . When other reviewers give 1 star to the book it is clear for me that perhaps they were expecting something magical that did not NOT_occur . This presentation of logic and its applications to informatics provides an excellent way to learn and really use the knowledge in the praxis . In Chapter 8 you go seamlessly from propositional to higher order logic . Sums and logical quantifications are , for example , treated in an uniform way . Maybe the type concept is not NOT_so NOT_fine NOT_explained , but one has to remember that this is an introductory book.5 stars , of course", "I just saw the movie and throughly enjoyed the performance by all the actors involved .

Among my faves on the album include \" The Reason \" , \" Immortality \" with The Bee Gees ( for a \" Celine - less \" version of the song , check out The Bee Gees ' 2-disc hits collection from 2001 ) , \" Love Is On The Way \" , the very funky \" Treat Her Like A Lady \" , \" To Love You More \" and the beautiful singalong title track .    This album also housed \" My Heart Will Go On \" which certainly helped push this album to sales over 9 million .    While it was a song that you wanted to smash the stereo at the time because it was being played every five minutes , I 'd say enough time has passed that once again you can enjoy and appreciate this beautiful , powerful ballad . With \" Falling Into You \" and this album , Celine was the # 1 female artist for a period , becoming a superstar right as Mariah was abandoning AC for r&b , as Alanis was going on hiatus for awhile , and when Shania was taking off but had n't NOT_yet NOT_exploded NOT_into major - superstardom .

( reviewed at eng wah 's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio ) \" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise . Unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited . Unlike fires , there is no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_combat them . Unlike floods , their terror is sudden . \" - excerpt from twister production notes I 'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before . I for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado - caused destruction comes NOT_no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes ........ that is until i saw twister . The destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not NOT_widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable . It will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc ..... Basically anything in its path that is not NOT_firmly NOT_rooted to the ground and in twister , you 'll get to see all this - close up ! Twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers . These people are basically out - of - their - mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister - occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can ..... that Is if the tornado does not NOT_suddenly NOT_decide NOT_to NOT_change its path towards them ! Jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes . While they are gearing up for the mother - of - all - storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo . Apparently , bill has left his rogue - ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman . He catches up with his old - self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife - to - be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city - bred woman toting around with a handphone . Jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement 's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early - warning system can be implemented . The problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function . To add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation - funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device . Thus begins the race ; jo 's cheap government equipment with beaten - up vehicles against jonas 's high - tech computers and satellite link - ups with their sleek , black all - terrain vans . Plot wise , there are not NOT_really NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_shout NOT_about . Twister is as predictable as any summer box - office hit can get . There is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well - off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) . Helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors / actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself ! Thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm 's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock ! Jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences . Like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited . Audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen ! The surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister ! ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect - dependent movie .

The thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band . Have you heard Depeche Mode 's albums with a wind of Boards of Canada ?                 Call this the album that it would have made more sense for Maximo Park to create if you will but this album is America 's response to all other international bands showing us off hard . ( The band is from San Francisco , I believe ) And their influence for this album is a mix of Electronica and 80 's music ( My Bloody Valentine . New Order ? Depeche Mode ? ) all leading them to create an album that does n't NOT_quite NOT_call NOT_the NOT_band NOT_in question an American Radiohead per se , but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars , accompanying keyboards , and a leaders effort to push the band forward , a band that is trying to reach heights of originality .                  Film School 's debut ( if you are n't NOT_counting NOT_their NOT_imported NOT_EP ) kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating \" On and On \" that may force your urge to name this band after Interpol and Elefant and a little bit of The Bravery in there , too , but will not NOT_let NOT_you NOT_throughout this entire album . Their current single \" Pitfalls \" may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back New Wave these days , but worse can happen for a band like this . The backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference . The second actual interlude \" Garrison \" is where Boards of Canada 's wind starts blowing through the CD , before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of \" cool \" .

Rating : 7.5/1", "The Clean kick - started the illustrious New Zealand label Flying Nun in 1981 , providing a key blueprint for indie - rockers from Australia ( the Chills ) to California ( Pavement ) . Over this two - disc , 46-track set of rarities and essentials , the trio takes the chugga - chugga racket of the Velvet Underground and stretches it into an entire garage aesthetic of excited , rudimentary playing , shaky , Kiwi - accented vocals and endearing melodies . Disc one , as influential for the lo - fi sonics as for the songs , ends with the Clean 's 1983 breakup . Disc two spans their 1988 reunion and 1996 's Unknown Country , mining similar material with even more exciting ( and even better - sounding ) results .

There was refurbishment work going on so it may be there are older rooms on other floors Some people have expressed concern about safety walking the streets around Terminii station . This hotel is at the north - west end of Via Principe Amedeo and the immediate area seemed quite touristy and safe . with street - side cafes in abundance . One evening we walked the length of the street and it changes character as you go south - east - if you are nervous . then I 'd avoid going much further along than Via Gioberti . four blocks away Access to the main train station . the metro and the bus station is very easy . we visited most sites in Rome using the 64 or 40 buses that go between Terminii and the bottom end of St Peters . and or the metro . With a three - day pass this was easy to do . You can also walk to some of the attractions . but do not NOT_forget that Terminii is at the top of a long rise if you plan to walk back Breakfast was good . other reports have accurately described what is on offer . We never had to queue but August in Rome is not NOT_the NOT_busiest NOT_time of the year for hotels . We did encounter several Japanese tour groups during our stay We never ate an evening meal in the hotel . but used some of the pizzerias and trattorias in the surrounding area . Some were better than others . Choose carefully . Our best meal was when we decided to go for Chinese fare rather than Italian . at Mr Chow .

I had never been particularly interested in country music .   But , one day I was listening to a country radio station and Vince Gill was singing & quot;When Ever You Come Around&quot ; and I was hooked . This CD is as consistant as all his others . Great lyics and superb musicianship . I rate this five stars as I believe Gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today", "Eddie murphy has had his share of ups and downs during his career . Known for his notorious late 80 's slump , murphy has still managed to bounce back with a handful of hits in the past few years . With the exception of the dreadful holy man , he appears to be on pace for a full - fledged comeback . Life was a great move on the part of murphy and co - star martin lawrence , because it 's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap - sticky drivel . Director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and does n't NOT_insert NOT_a NOT_distracting NOT_plot NOT_to NOT_back them up . Life is , in a sense , one great balancing act with murphy on one end and lawrence on the other . Amazingly , the scale never tips in either 's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other . As the movie opens , we 're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two - timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club . There he meets a successful businessman named claude banks ( martin lawrence ) . Somehow , after multiple contrivances , the mismatched pair find themselves on their way to mississippi on a moonshine run . When all is said and done , ray and claude have been framed for a murder that was actually committed by the town sheriff . Hence the setting of life : mississippi state prison , where the main characters come to realize their unlikely friendship is important , and become set on finding an fool - proof escape plan . The film takes us from the 30 's all the way to the 90 's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude . Luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner . Not NOT_only NOT_do NOT_we NOT_believe NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_look NOT_as NOT_if NOT_they NOT_'re NOT_90 NOT_years NOT_old , but they sound like it , too . Murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards . This is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it 's sleeve . While the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it 's core . But the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars . The movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it 's an overwhelming delight . I could say a few bad things about the movie , but i do n't NOT_want NOT_to . It 's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll .", "This \" dumb \" cowboy blondie who thinks he is a ` darn ' good loverboy , decides to leave his dusty ol' town somewhere in texas and go to new york . He puts on his beloved cowboy attire and off he hops on the next new york coach . When he arrives to new york , he immediately sets out to play mr playboy thinking he is the best ` darn ' ` stud ' in the whol'o ' new york city . Obviously he fails . He meets the ' cripple ' rico ( dustin hoffman , who is terrifically good ) in a bar . Rico has a leg that is paralysed from the knee down , so he walks in a peculiar way . Rico is a thief and wants to get some money off this ' rich ' dumb cowboy . He cheats our cowboy out of $ 20 through a somewhat detailed routine and disappears . Soon , our cowboy runs out of money : he gets kicked out of his hotel , and starts getting hungry . Walking through the city , with \" everybody 's talkin ' \" playing in the background ( oh , and his prided techno transistor radio in hand ) , he spots rico in a cafe . Rico , half - scared , pours out all the money in his pocket . 60 filthy cents . Our cowboy , hungry , is forgiving . He is glad he found someone he knows . Rico offers to make it up for him . And he invites him to his place . And what a filthy , cold place it is . Our cowboy falls asleep instantly in the ( junk ) bed . When he finally wakes ( jumps ? ) Up , he finds rico looking at him . \" you wanna cup'a'coffee ? \" Rico asks in his friendly , sleazy , somewhat - childish manner while he smokes on a ciggy . \" what 're you ? A goddamn faggot ? What do you want from me ? Where are my shoes ? What did you do to them ? \" But all his doubts turn out to be unfounded . Rico really has a heart . Together , they live in the junk apartment and almost freeze to death . Rico is convinced that the best place to be is florida , where the sun shines beautifully and there are lots of coconut trees . But he falls sick and is convinced that his cure is to go to florida . \" we will soon be in miami \" is the last sentence uttered in this film and what a shocking , moving end of a film it is . The classic theme music : \" midnight cowboy \" helps bring about the feeling of attachment that most viewers will experience towards the end of the film . Whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable .", "With the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late ' 90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . For the former , you need look no NOT_further NOT_than director tom tykwer 's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . Lola , a contemporary goth - girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . It seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he does n't NOT_deliver NOT_a NOT_hundred NOT_thousand NOT_marks NOT_within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . This gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . So she runs -- not NOT_just NOT_jogs , NOT_sprints -- NOT_in hopes that somehow , someway , she 'll be able to obtain the money and save a life . > from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like \" sliding doors on steroids . With a non - stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . Indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . Very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . The way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer 's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . Thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . While you are watching , this will not NOT_matter . Running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . It is the equivalent of a roller - coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;", "Synopsis : shrek ( myers ) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest , until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . Farquaad agrees to relocate the pests , on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desires to we d -- from a far - off castle . Grudgingly , shrek sets out , joined in his quest by an unwanted companion , donkey ( murphy ) . Review : one memorable aspect of disney 's \" aladdin \" was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents . \" shrek \" does the same for eddie murphy ; ironically , though , murphy 's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass . All the same , \" shrek \" does represent murphy 's best comic outing in years , and as donkey he steals all the best lines . For instance , after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature , donkey soars into the air and scoffs , \" now i 'm a flying talking donkey ! \" And despite its many contributors , the script for \" shrek \" is full of such comic gems . Myers is delightful in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also gets some great moments ( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man ) . \" shrek \" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts , and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain . Things do go somewhat astray during the film 's middle segment , which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie 's greatest strength . But even then , one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation , whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology .", "Gun 's & Roses came out in the nick of time .

Trust me .", "Location . Location . Location .   I have just returned from a 4 day short break in Rome with my parents . uncle and fiance . and we stayed at the Hotel Adriano . 02 - 05 April 2008 .   The location of the hotel is fantastic - it is only a 5 minute walk to the Pantheon . and just a few minutes more to Piazza Navona . The Vatican and St Peters are also easily accesible on foot . The hotel is located in a safe part of town on a small side street . Via di Pallacorda .   and although there is some traffic . and boy do they drive quickly .   we were not NOT_overly NOT_bothered NOT_by NOT_noise . despite having rooms overlooking the road . The location is second to NOT_none and just perfect for exploring Rome on foot . One point perhaps worth knowing is that many of the streets are cobbled and tough on your feet . so sensible walking shoes are a must . I struggled in my heeled boots . . Another tip is to take the hop - on . hop - off buses around Rome . which are great for giving an overview of the city and great value for money . Euro 19 for 24 hours .   The Colosseum and Forum are quite a way from the hotel as they are located in the south east of Rome . and therefore it is well worth taking advantage of the bus to hop off here . The hotel reception can advise where to get on the bus . I loved the hotel on first sight . It is situated within an old palazzo and has lots of character and charm . The reception and bar area have recently been renovated and are quite minimalist and chic - just to my liking . There are plenty of comfy seats and public areas and a nice bar . although not NOT_many NOT_people seemed to use the bar - probably as the hotel is so close to the plethora of bars and restaurants around Piazza Navona .   The bar also has a plasma screen although this is not NOT_on all the time The hotel has 2 lifts - although they are tiny . and a friendly porter will take your bags to your room on arrival . My first impression of the hotel was great so I was actually very disappointed when my fiance and I got to our room - a double room - number 227 . which was small . dark . dingy and musty . The ceilings were low and the room had a small window with no NOT_view NOT_at NOT_all . The room was small and there was not NOT_much NOT_space NOT_to NOT_walk NOT_around NOT_the NOT_bed . The wallpaper was hanging off in some places and the wall was scratched . There was no NOT_remote NOT_control NOT_for our air - conditioning . and no NOT_key NOT_to NOT_open NOT_the NOT_wardrobe . I could have lived with all of these things for 3 nights but the bathroom was TERRIBLE . It was minute - so small that it was hard to get in . The shower looked like something from a horror film with a grubby white shower curtain and dripping showerhead that would not NOT_stay NOT_in NOT_place and mould in places on the tiles . There was no NOT_bath and toilettries were in short supply . The toilet area had an unpleasant smell of drains and I just knew that I could not NOT_stay NOT_there . I was very worried as I had chosen the hotel and was concerned that my parents would have a bad room too . but when I visited their room . 231 - also a double . it was fabulous . It had obviously recently been renovated and was clean and bright with high ceilings and exposed beams . It was not NOT_huge . but perfectly acceptable . and the height and bright walls gave the illusion of space . Everything in their room worked . Their bathroom was gigantic with a brand new gleaming bath suite and perfect shower . My uncle 's single room . 224 . had not NOT_been NOT_renovated NOT_but NOT_was NOT_OK . and he was quite happy . He did not NOT_have NOT_a NOT_bath - NOT_only NOT_a NOT_shower . but his bathroom was adequate for one person . The room was quite small . but not NOT_cramped . The next morning I told the nice man at the reception desk that I was not NOT_happy with my room and he moved us straight away - no NOT_questions NOT_asked and no NOT_fuss . He could not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_more NOT_helpful . We moved to room 122 . It had not NOT_been NOT_renovated NOT_either . but was a LOT better than our original room and had a bath with a shower overhead . The wallpaper was peeling slightly in places and in truth it could have done with a makeover . but the problems here were simply cosmetic and did not NOT_worry NOT_me NOT_unduly . as it was clean and smell - free . well . apart from a faint smell of smoke - common in Italian hotel rooms where smoking is nearly always permitted . . We even had hotel slippers on our beds The breakfasts were very good - served between 07 00 and 10 00 in the charming breakfast room on the ground floor . There was a good choice of continental breakfast fare - cereals . toast . bread . croissants . ham . cheese . fruit . biscuits . boiled eggs . but no NOT_cooked NOT_breakfast . not NOT_that NOT_this NOT_seemed NOT_to NOT_bother NOT_anyone .   Everyone just finds a table and helps themselves . 09 00 seemed to be a busy time so we tried to breakfast around 08 50 to avoid queuing . although to be fair I did not NOT_see NOT_anyone NOT_having NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_for NOT_a NOT_table and as soon as something ran out it was quickly replaced . To sum up . I would definitely recommend this hotel . although I would suggest that you request a refurbished room when booking and if you do not NOT_get NOT_one . do not NOT_be NOT_afraid NOT_to NOT_ask NOT_to NOT_change NOT_rooms . Despite the problems with my first room . this hotel is definitely great value for money and I would stay here again . The location is amazing and the staff were really friendly and helpful .

We spent four nights there in early November The hotel staff were very welcoming and were only too pleased to provide us with advice on places to see and make recommendations for restaurants etc . The room was clean but rather garishly decorated . It had very atmospheric subdued lighting which was fine except that it made identifying the contents of one 's suitcase at night a bit difficult .   Breakfast was served in a rather small but adequate room . A good range of the usual cold buffet items was provided .

Qui - gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . Anakin participates in a heart - pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui - gon 's ship . However , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . Meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit 's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . There are hardly NOT_any NOT_emotional NOT_scenes NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film- NOT_even NOT_when NOT_we NOT_discover NOT_that NOT_anakin NOT_will NOT_be NOT_leaving NOT_his NOT_slave NOT_mother NOT_behind NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_jedi NOT_training , NOT_the NOT_frenzied NOT_excitement NOT_of NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_film NOT_wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . This does not NOT_prove NOT_that NOT_the NOT_phantom NOT_menace NOT_is NOT_poorly NOT_made NOT_for NOT_it NOT_is NOT_brilliantly NOT_made . In all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not NOT_for NOT_uplifting purposes . Despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without NOT_flaws . For starters , we have the ill - conceived , moronic character jar - jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . What a klutz ! George lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . Secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie 's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic - book feel of the previous three star wars installments . This is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie 's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . The movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . I ca n't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . However , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . Natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . There is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . Jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . Despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . The heightened excitement of the final sequences does n't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge - of - your - seat fun in their own rite . The film is a treasure to look at . The visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8 % of the time- the awe - inspiring , mouth - opening , eye - popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . Not since 1997 's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . The production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick 's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang 's classic silent metropolis . However , all the sets are so original . The original star wars movies ca n't even match the grandeur of this film 's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . The costumes are remarkable and have jean - paul gaultier written all over them . Whether its queen amadala 's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold - embroidery and feathers , or the jedis ' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . The costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . As for john williams ' score , i do n't think he 's done one as complex or powerful since ? i ca n't even remember . It is as epic as his schindler 's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . It includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . What with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . There is very little to hate in the film : it 's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . It is the best \" fun \" film and the best big - budget film out today , most definitely .", "This book has been golden for two of my undergrad communications classes and is turning out an invalvuable reference for my graduate level comm class , which the professor is teaching from a variety of books .

I know those songs by heart", "I will start this review by noting two things . I greatly appreciated Nussbaum 's ' Upheavals of Thought ' , and I am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society I live in . ( But , then , I recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society I am embedded in . ) But Wedekind 's play ' Springtime Awakening ' should raise alarm bells for most of us . We are sexual beings ( most of us anyway ) and we have to deal with that - learn to accept it within ourselves , learn to share it with others ( it is , of course , the quintessential sharing experience ) , learn to grow with it , learn to let it go .... The easy path to take is to grasp a social ' norm ' and follow it regardless of the morality of that path . Societies do present many ' norms ' to a young person developing sexual awareness but not NOT_all NOT_of these are equally desirable . If Nussbaum 's book does nothing NOT_else NOT_but NOT_diminish NOT_the NOT_acceptability NOT_of NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_undesirable ' NOT_norms ' , NOT_and NOT_enhance NOT_the NOT_more NOT_socially NOT_responsible NOT_ones NOT_it NOT_will NOT_have NOT_achieved NOT_a NOT_great NOT_service . There are curious things in this book for me . Nussbaum refers to many sources but many of them are male - Aristotle , Seneca , JS Mill , DH Lawrence .... To be fair , the last chapter is about ' To the Lighthouse ' by Virginia Woolf , and other writers such as Andrea Dworkin are prominent . However I was surprised that some powerful women writers are totally ignored - where is Mary Wolstonecraft , where is Emma Goldman , where is Mary Shelley ? Why is ' Maurice ' ( Forster ) referred to but not ' The Well of Loneliness ' ( Hall ) ? The chapter on female genital mutilation ( FGM ) is an appalling indictment on the behaviour of some societies . Nussbaum has a glancing reference to circumcision ; not NOT_surpringly it is glancing for someone who was converted ( so I read ) to Judaism . While I would never compare what happens to baby boys with what happens to young women in severity or risk , nevertheless I think the motivations for both practices come from the same source . If , for cultural ( religious ) reasons it is appropriate for Jewish boys to be circumcised , I think it is a very dangerous position to take to expect other societies to abandon the practices they see as legitimate , if NOT_not mandatory . The chapter on Equity and Mercy impressed me immensely - it is so balanced I expect many feminists will hate it . But for me , her rare use of a Christian quote ( ' Forgive them , for they know not NOT_what NOT_they NOT_do . ' ) was a revelation . Never NOT_before had I seen how compromised that plea is . ( Compare with Tolstoy : ' It is a wonderful thing to be loved because of oneself , but it is a far more wonderful thing to be loved in spite of oneself . ' ) The fact that often I have other feelings than Nussbaum expresses does not NOT_concern NOT_me , because she often has perspectives that broaden or hone my own thoughts . In the chapter on prostitution and its illegality I had to agree with most of what she writes simply from a libertarian point of view rather than one of morality . The morality issues are complex - perhaps irresolvably complex . Just as there are men with ' dangerous ' sexuality , so there are women . Perhaps it 's only an issue for men because they demand or expect control . For me , all of Nussbaum 's discussions seem to centre on the effects on women that prostitution entails - this is not NOT_inappopriate NOT_even NOT_though NOT_it NOT_may NOT_not NOT_be NOT_balanced . The problem I see with prostitution is that it panders to the man 's ' need ' to have sex . They can get it on demand . This reduces their sensitivities to the needs of the women in their lives , including the need ( wise or not ) for a woman to have a faithful partner . In Australia we had an advisor on women 's affairs to the Federal Government write a piece in a newspaper where she expressed the view - based on her own practice - that a woman should always make sure her husband knew where the red light district was in a city they were visiting , so he could satisfy his ' need ' when she herself felt incapable . For me this is an appalling suggestion - as if men can not have self - control and should not be expected to . But , for all of that , like Nussbaum I would not see prostitution as worthy of being made illegal . For me this was a thought - provoking read . It had some incredibly ugly things to describe , to consider . But it helped me to structure my thoughts in this difficult area - perhaps it will help me guide my boys as they reach maturity .

I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row , and waiting for the fourth song to end .

This record is her first with friend Jessica Harp .    The ladies mine the borderline between the singer / songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format . Highlights include the opening track Leave the Pieces , Way Back Home , The Good Kind , and the title track Stand Still Look Pretty .   Of special note is the presence of producer / multi - instrumentalist John Leventhal on many tracks . I recommend this record for folks who like songs that do n't NOT_sound NOT_like formula country", "i do not NOT_own NOT_this NOT_CD , but i recently saw the doctor at a local jazz club and was blown away .

Its a very great book , and fills you in on some information that you might have missed", "Anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline . It 's true beauty comes from it 's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it 's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman . Anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband . With son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun - fat ) to tutor his son in the english language . Mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country 's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world . Anna function is to help provide that link . The core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate . Foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide - eyed wonder . She is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him . It is one of foster 's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not NOT_have NOT_played NOT_earlier NOT_in her career . She brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not NOT_have NOT_come NOT_across NOT_from a younger foster . It 's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut 's monarchy . When she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid - film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance . Chow - yun fat 's king mongkut is every measure of foster 's anna , perhaps even more so . This is the chow yun - fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years . He is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern . It is an impressively assured and nuanced performance . Precious time is stolen from the movie 's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king 's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner . It strikes with the subtlety of siam 's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story . Some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie . Although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british . Anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness . It shows a seduction of intelligence . Ever mindful of each other 's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if NOT_not achingly bittersweet .", "The best book on the history of World War II that I 've read in a long time . The title has three meanings : 1 . It can refer to the gunner at the back of a bomber . The Brits called these people ' Rear Gunners . ' The Yanks used the term ' Tail Gunner . ' It 's the most dangerous position in the plane . 2 . The last plane in the formation . This was more true in the American Combat Box than in British usage . This position is difficult to hold because it is at the end of a string and every move by the lead ship propagates irregularily through the formation . It is also more dangerous as enemy fighters can attack this ship more easily since there are n't NOT_so NOT_many NOT_guns NOT_pointing that direction . 3 . It can refer to the bombing missions near the end of the war . This splendid book covers all three of these meanings . In addition it does an excellent job of discussing the power and importance of air power in the defeat of Germany", "Thirty five years ago my high school ( Thomas Jefferson , in Federal Way , Washington ) held annual competitions in mathematics .   They did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet , just was a few pages long .   There were n't NOT_many NOT_questions , NOT_perhaps NOT_a NOT_dozen NOT_or NOT_two ( NOT_usually NOT_in NOT_the NOT_form NOT_of NOT_story NOT_problems ) , but they required deep thought and concentration ( at least for me ) .   I still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as I took the \" white book \" and opened it to the first problem .   Several hours later I 'd consider myself accomplished if I 'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions .   Ian Stewart 's book reminds me of those tests .   Here 's a sampling of what 's inside:1)Mrs . Anne - Lida Worm decides she wants a new couch , and tells Mr. Worm to get it for her , while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby Wermintrude .   But Anne - Lina does n't NOT_want NOT_just NOT_any NOT_couch .   She wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house , and around the 90-degree hall at the end .   What shape does the couch have , and how big is it ?   This is a truly riveting story .   Will Mr. Worm solve the couch problem in time ?   2)Alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes , evaluating the influence of different soils .   He wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine .   His land is on a hillside , though , which is narrow , so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land .   How can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species , where any two plots have exactly one variety in common , and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot?Sixteen chapters make up this book .   Though their titles are whimsical , the mathematical problems are n't .   Some are still unsolved .   Even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics , they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions , and developed insight along the way , that are at once challenging and rewarding .   Here 's a sample of some of other topics discussed in Stewart 's book : How might one transport a lion , llama , and head of lettuce in a boat , across a lake , NOT_without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker ?   How can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve ?   How can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place ?   Suppose that you need to tile a room , and the tiles come in odd shapes .   Is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution ?   Can mathematics tell us things about evolution , such as whether or not NOT_evolution NOT_comes NOT_gradually NOT_or NOT_in NOT_spurts ( NOT_or NOT_both ) ?   This is a fun , lighthearted book , but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think .   I enjoy reading as I exercise on my elliptical machine .   I get double the sense of accomplishment when I can read and workout at the same time .   Ordinarily , I can estimate how long I 've been on the machine by how many pages I 've read - 20 pages in 40 minutes is about average .   But with Stewart 's book I had to be careful .   Several times I found that I 'd worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half - a - dozen pages or so .   If you love mathematics , particularly mathematical puzzles , then this is a book you 'll really enjoy .   It has many problems for the reader , with answers at the back of each chapter .   If you do the problems and understand everything in the book , in detail , it will occupy many hours of your time .   All in deep thought and utter enjoyment .", "The title gets it right - this is a very fun album . There are a lot of great songs on here .

Rarer still are those who have never been kissed before they reach the twenties . Hardest to believe still , is that drew barrymore has never been kissed . Despite all these hard to believe tit bits , there are people out there who have never truly been kissed , and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet , sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling , reassuring them that their search for true love is over . Well , this movie is about a girl waiting for the right boy to give her the kiss of her life . And it 's sweet . Drew barrymore who shone in ? ever after ' is wonderful as ? josie , grossy ' , the high school dweeb who becase a professional editor , before being assigned by her paper to return to school as an undercover reporter . It addresses the issues of how a dweeb , becomes a prom queen and finds the man of her life all in one sitting . Hard to believe , but possible . There may also be those who have been kissed before , but in fact , never truly been given the kiss . So this movie can be watched by those who are waiting for true love or those who are still searching for it . Either way , it is one enjoyable sit , with a fairytale ending .", "James cmaeron 's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok . For those of you who do not NOT_know NOT_the NOT_plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race . Human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed . However , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor . To stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor 's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born . In response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn . Images of machines and of humans ' reliance on machines dominate the film . Even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines . In the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone -- his own spiritual power -- to destroy the death star . In the terminator , however , sara must use another machine -- a giant hydraulic press -- to vanquish her enemy . Cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable -- and he 's not NOT_happy NOT_about NOT_it . Unabated technological growth brings about the terminator 's other obsession : the apocalypse . We have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la . Children watch the flames in a burning television . When the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him . Even though the \" future is not NOT_set , \" there is no NOT_doubt NOT_about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence . All sara can do is await it . ( cameron does n't NOT_wimp NOT_out NOT_like NOT_he NOT_does NOT_in terminator 2 ) The end of the world is the human race 's own fault , too . After all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place . Back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron 's ) . These days , one can read a criticism of machine - like behavior in humans . True , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield 's and lance henriksen 's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected . Cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la . From a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done . Arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist -- unstoppable , merciless , obdurate . We are not NOT_meant NOT_to NOT_empathize NOT_with NOT_this NOT_ultimate NOT_killing NOT_machine NOT_as NOT_we NOT_are NOT_in NOT_some NOT_of NOT_schwarzenegger NOT_'s NOT_later NOT_works ( NOT_eg , NOT_commando ) , NOT_but NOT_fear NOT_him . Cameron and hurd 's script basically depicts a one hour and forty - five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot . While we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese 's intentions . Cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace . Either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving -- usually both occurs . The violence is not NOT_particularly NOT_graphic ( NOT_temple NOT_of NOT_doom NOT_'s NOT_heart - NOT_pull NOT_scene NOT_outgrosses NOT_the NOT_terminator NOT_'s ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective . For a low budget film , the terminator 's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done . Special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton . It is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen . One thing that does n't NOT_hold NOT_up NOT_after all the years , however , is linda hamilton 's hairdo .", "Jigga is incredibly hot on this albumBeanie is good to great .

Good value for cost - would definitely stay there again .", "With stars like sigourney weaver ( \" alien \" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . Sadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . Helen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . Incidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . A year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . Detective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . Copycat \" borrows \" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . But copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also ... Much of the time wasted could 've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . Even so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments ... Weaver being the vulnerable yet strong - within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . Harry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . Which comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please ... ) . Copycat is a good thriller . Although the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . This worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . Nice movie to bring your girlfriend to ....", "Just lay back and listen . Brian Wilson never misses a note . His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop . His composing and arranging skills are without NOT_peer and he even plays some awesome bass ( the slow middle eight section on & quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;)on this album . These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling   both excited and uncertain . Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves , this is a true pop magnum opus . The best tracks are the gorgeous & quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot ; , & quot;Don't Talk ( Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot ; ) , the title cut , and the tear inducing & quot;Caroline No&quot ; . Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity , Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that have n't NOT_aged NOT_a NOT_day since 1966 . The more you listen to & quot;Pet Sounds&quot ; , the more it 's beauty envelopes you", "This book , unlike Morris 's work on Hillary , is actually worth reading , because its perspective and analysis of our 42nd president is fascinating . Though the title is a little tiresome ( and becomes especially so when Morris continues to say throughout the book ` Why ? Because he could ! ' ) the book is a fast page turner .   I particularly enjoyed Morris 's portrayal of Clinton as one who only came to life around other people : if they were happy , he was , if they were in distress , he felt their pain . A master of reading people and changing according to their feelings , Clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president who ruled by polls . Enter Dick Morris . As Clinton 's chief poller , he also became , at one time , his chief political advisor . And Clinton needed one . As ` My Life ' by Clinton shows , the president had no NOT_overall NOT_strategy and failed to see events as interconnected . For him , each issue needed to be examined individually and with Clinton , that was a laborious endeavor :   the prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with equal weight , and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious to take action . Result ? Fiasco 's like Waco , Somalia , Bosnia and Health Care reform . More seriously for the future : the loss of the Congress to the Republicans ( over ten years now and counting ) and the failure to stop Bin Laden .   Morris gives credit where credit is due though : Clinton 's work on welfare reform cut the roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction allowed the economic boom of the 1990s to take place . Also interesting , was Clinton 's use of the presidency as a bully pulpit for families and education : an issue that was local politics , and therefore cost Clinton nothing NOT_in NOT_the NOT_budget but brought in massive political capital . Read this book before reading Clinton 's ` My Life ' .   Why ? Because Morris points out the inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein .   Also , Morris says that the president 's autobiography is the ` Rosetta Stone ' that decodes Clinton . If that is the case , then Morris is certainly the interpreter .", "I just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought , and I found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me .

Anyone visiting Sanibel ( especially first - timers ) should definitely get a copy before they go .", "I want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean 's war picture . I still think that \" the bridge on the river kwai \" does n't NOT_deserve NOT_being the number 13 in the american film institute 's list of the 100 greatest american movies . And i think that \" 12 angry men \" , \" witness for the prosecution \" and \" paths of glory \" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 . But i ca n't NOT_deny NOT_the NOT_importance NOT_of \" NOT_the NOT_bridge NOT_on NOT_the NOT_river NOT_kwai \" - NOT_cinematically NOT_and NOT_in NOT_its NOT_contents . The film is set in burma in 1943 . A batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai . But the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers need n't NOT_work as simple workmen . Struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect . Afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge . He considers it an opportunity to raise his men 's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese . But the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) ... A flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people . They are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge . And the film does n't NOT_consistently NOT_question NOT_the NOT_military NOT_spirit NOT_as NOT_kubrick NOT_does NOT_in \" NOT_paths NOT_of NOT_glory \" . Lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies . This is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito . In this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person . The audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson 's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or NOT_not . The spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men . ( the plot by - passes these risks . ) That means , the picture is n't NOT_perfect . But it has a lot of virtues as well . \" the bridge on the river kwai \" shows the \" madness \" of war and what it can produce in people 's minds . It shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics . And lean 's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests . These points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti - war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) . David lean 's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect . His film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not NOT_wholly NOT_plausible ) showdown . The film is also well - photographed and has an apt score . Alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character . The other actors deliver fine performances as well . I like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

After this novel , she is one of my new absolute favorites and I have vowed to read everything this amazing author has written . I began to read The Virgin in the Garden , and could not NOT_put NOT_it NOT_down . I was enraptured by the beautiful descriptions of the two contrasting \" Elizabethian ages \" and the characters . Frederica has to be one of the most despicable , and yet intriguing literary characters in years . My breath was also taken away by the story of Marcus Potter -- a haunting , amazing character that will stay with you for days . The way Byatt writes , she transports you to 1950s England and the lives of the Potters . I felt as if I knew these characters like family , and could almost sit down to lunch with them by the end of the book . Her style , timing , and subtle metaphors of passion and life are irresistible and amazing .

I would recommend this hotel .", "Marie ( charlotte rampling , \" aberdeen \" ) and jean ( bruno cremet , \" sorcerer \" ) are a comfortable , sixty - ish married couple looking forward to a peaceful vacation at their second home in lit et mix . On their first , full day , marie sunbathes as jean goes for a swim . Hours later , marie 's initiated a full scale search when jean has n't NOT_returned , but no NOT_trace NOT_of him is found . Marie returns to paris and resumes her life , including chats with jean at the end of each day in francois ozon 's \" under the sand . \" Marie 's ex - pat british friend amanda ( alexandra stewart , \" frantic \" ) and her french husband gerard ( pierre vernier ) try to snap marie out of her denial with a dinner party , where they introduce her to the handsome vincent ( jacques nolot , \" nenette et boni \" ) , yet marie suggests that gerard accompany her and jean to their gym the next morning . Eventually marie does begin dating vincent , but she discusses him with jean and even smiles at jean , hidden behind a bedroom curtain , when she makes love to vincent . Slowly , though , reality continues to chip away at marie 's fantasy life . Her bank advises her that without NOT_access NOT_to NOT_jean NOT_'s NOT_account , NOT_she NOT_needs NOT_to NOT_reduce her spending . One of her university students ( she 's reading virginia woolf 's \" the waves \" ) turns out to be one of the young men who participated in the beach search . Then police arrive asking her to identify the clothing of a body they 've found washed up from the ocean . That night , jean 's not NOT_at NOT_home NOT_when NOT_she NOT_returns NOT_to NOT_their NOT_apartment . Her mother - in - law ( andree tainsy ) cruelly Insists that jean simply abandoned her out of boredom . Finally , marie goes to the police , insisting on viewing the body . Horrified ( she 's been warned it was In an advanced state of putrefaction ) , she laughs when handed a bagged watch , insisting that this is not NOT_her NOT_husband . \" under the sand \" is a character study and melancholy portrait of aging ( ' i 've lost my youth , ' marie declares ) and loss . Charlotte rampling , given the chance to portray an older , yet still sexual , woman runs with it , bringing us into the mind of the character . Her chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural . As marie returns from her first date with vincent , she sits on the couch with jean . ' did he kiss you ? ' he asks . The mood the two create is incredibly intimate and sad . Ozon ( \" water drops on burning rocks , \" \" see the sea \" ) , who cowrote the script with emmanuelle bernheim , marcia romano , and marina de van , has turned in a more mature work than his previous , creepy \" see the sea . \" While he cleverly never lets us see jean enter the water that fateful day , leaving a number of possibilities - accident ? , suicide ? , escape ? - open , he definitely tips his hand towards a certain outcome . Cinematography by antoine hiberli and jeanne lapoirie ( \" water drops on burning rocks \" ) glides around marie ( their 180 shot as she initially searches the ocean 's horizon for a sign of jean conveys her panic ) or captures rampling 's exotic face in mood divining closeup . In an inventive fantasy scene , marie imagines jean 's hands massaging her feet while in a state of auto - arousal . His two hands become four , then more combined with her own , becoming almost a one person orgy and recalling roman polanski 's \" repulsion . \" Original music by philippe rombi quietly adds to the overall melancholy . \" under the sand \" is a unique portrait of loss . It would make an fascinating double bill with liv ullmann 's \" faithless \" from earlier this year , another character study of a woman facing loss for different reasons .", "Just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas could n't NOT_be NOT_more NOT_appropriate . With all of the attention thrown to \" family films \" in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it 's high time we raised the intellectual level of children 's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios . With that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago . Nightmare is the story of one man 's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego . Jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere . But during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday . After the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world . Imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around . Upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping \" sandy claws , \" employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children . He then aims to take over the role as primary joy - provider and gift - bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had . Alas , the co - mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie Tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee - wee 's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare . Originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) . The stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it 's simple yet compelling story . The direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters . Also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing . The nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone . It 's not NOT_just NOT_child NOT_'s NOT_play for the holidays ; it 's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , NOT_without compromise . What better message is there for christmas ?", "Well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he does n't NOT_look NOT_it ! Daylight is a great disaster movie . If you 've seen cliffhanger , you 'll know stallone 's character already . A guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . A tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste . A dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! ) Stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion . Then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom ! > from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged . Most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat . There are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well . There is no NOT_general NOT_antagonist NOT_in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that . Daylight is a great film , i saw a non - matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny .

Melodies are beautifully simple and soothing , sounds are particularly well crafted . A great album . The drum box could be a bit more discreet though", "The second jackal - based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo 's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . The story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not NOT_pretend NOT_to NOT_be 100 % factual . Plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant 's radical activities . He is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . Ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this \" assignment \" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double - personality syndrome ( which does not NOT_sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) Critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two - hour runtime . Admittedly , i was n't NOT_a NOT_huge NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_main NOT_actors NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film , NOT_and NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_from NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . The first hour is mostly just a build - up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . Quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but did n't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . Sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they 've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold - heartedness of their chosen characters . I did n't like performance put forth from quinn 's wife in this flick , but then again , she does n't show up in most of the film , so that was n't so bad . I did however enjoy director duguay 's interesting style and cinematic vision . This thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . I thought that was neat . Having said that , i did n't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the \" fake \" jackal met with the \" real \" jackal 's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . Little known facts : ben kingsley 's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 \" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982 's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . Many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo 's haven of restfulness ) . Donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal .", "Best location and 5 star service .

What a stunning , touching , heart - wrenching , heart - warming , life - affirming , miraculous film . > from its opening moments , _ life is beautiful _ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy . A car with no NOT_brakes speeds through the town , and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way . They mistake him to be the fascist president , traveling to their town that day . Heil ! Heil ! Huh ? Shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces . This is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti - semitic society in which he = lives . Granted , _ the great dictator _ comes to mind -- charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece . I think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character . Benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race . Benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept . It = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema . There are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly . Slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_a NOT_universal NOT_language NOT_was NOT_being NOT_conveyed . And although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in . This is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family . The second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five - year old son , giosu = e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported . Guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child . For = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right . For his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not NOT_ask NOT_for seconds . Which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ? With persecution ? With injustice on the worst level ? It+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not NOT_realize NOT_they NOT_had . Other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim . Sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds . Benigni+s guido realizes this . He is the clown , but he is not NOT_a NOT_fool . He sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh . His liberty is stripped , but not NOT_his NOT_dignity , and certainly not NOT_the NOT_dignities NOT_of those around him . It+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor . Perhaps that is a form of denial . Perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not NOT_unlike NOT_the NOT_very NOT_different _ NOT_brazil _ ) . Or ... Perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no NOT_weapons but = wit . Whatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three - dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept . Surprisingly , it works . It is an important footnote that this film was not NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_be an accurate reflection of the holocaust . It+s not NOT_that NOT_the NOT_atrocities NOT_are NOT_trivialized , NOT_far NOT_from NOT_it . They don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror -- less is more . I believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing . However , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off - target . Benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo - in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) . He has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society . It swept the italian academy awards . Controversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film . Masterful . Miraculous .

King louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi . Such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre - augustin caron de beaumarchais . Beaumarchais was the author of the plays , \" the barber of seville \" and \" the marriage of figaro . \" Today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once . The movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light - hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture . One of france 's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year . Now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story . The secret of the film 's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac 's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais . With his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience . His wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning . In a land where court intrigue determines one 's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy . As our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship . Into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight . Beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man 's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided . That over with , the fight is on . With luchini 's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him . Audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney . Although he does not NOT_have NOT_half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style . Michael epp 's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean - marc kerdelhue 's lush but realistic looking sets . Jean - claude petit 's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies . Director jean - claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes . The disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good - hearted style . Typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water , taking his bath . One episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_man . Another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution . All of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but . The story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts . The radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie - therese , the real love of beaumarchais 's life . But he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him . Still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him . The movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time .

Oddly , the fascism of the Communist regime remains largely in place in the era following Mao 's disastrous reign , even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge , heavily - populated , and ( from a Western perspective)oftentimes strange land . Aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of Christianity in China , as well as introducing readers to the many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country . On a recent trip to China , I was highly impressed by the deep generosity , humility , resourcefulness , strength , perseverance , and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all ages . This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith . This spirit is also , I believe , one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many Chinese .

I 've heard people call this book too vague , but they ca n't NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_to NOT_do ; it does n't NOT_work NOT_that NOT_way . Once you get through the personality quiz portion , the author gives a somewhat detailed description of your specific personality type ( I for example am and ENFP ) and throws in suggestions in the description and also give a modest list of other possibilities .

I 'm lucky I found this book when I did ( and not NOT_3 - NOT_4 years into college ) because I found some satisfying   career options that I would not NOT_normally NOT_have NOT_chosen NOT_for myself and they are on the opposite end of the spectrum from what I was previously considering .

Wicked backgrounds and rhyming", "If there 's one thing in common about all of hollywood 's major studios , it 's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . Although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it 's obvious there 's no NOT_significant NOT_movement NOT_underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . So when a movie like gary ross ' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it 's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . Although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not NOT_be NOT_mistaken NOT_for NOT_a NOT_no - NOT_thought NOT_movie . Quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . The story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement - making in the cinema . Not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross ' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . Kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . It stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" Maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo - world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father - knows - best times . It 's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . Soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . At one end is a soda shop owner - turned - painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close - minded mayor ( j. t. Walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . Fine performances are turned in all around . Maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j. t. Walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . Daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman 's envy . For daniels , it 's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it 's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . Also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . There 's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who do n't .", "Any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission .

The dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis ! I can hear batfans everywhere protesting : \" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! \" And , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_someone NOT_at NOT_warner NOT_brothers NOT_had NOT_the NOT_savvy NOT_to NOT_cast NOT_jack NOT_nicholson NOT_in NOT_the NOT_role NOT_he NOT_was NOT_born NOT_to NOT_play . Nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar - worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman . Nicholson shows no NOT_inhibition NOT_or NOT_shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the ' 60s tv series ) . On one hand , nicholson 's joker is extremely funny . His murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film . But on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind . The joker 's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister . This guy is off his rocker , and he not NOT_only NOT_knows NOT_it , he flaunts it ! But enough about nicholson as the joker : i 'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman . Like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader . But batfans need not NOT_worry NOT_because NOT_holy NOT_unconventional NOT_casting ! Keaton delivers . He is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman . Even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city . Visually , batman is a knockout nothing NOT_short NOT_of NOT_a NOT_triumph NOT_for NOT_director NOT_tim NOT_burton NOT_and NOT_his NOT_production NOT_team . The movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as \" the dark knight returns \" and \" the killing joke . \" Burton 's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $ 35 million budget is definitely on the screen . The sets , costumes , and make - up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations . Nicholson is n't NOT_joking NOT_when NOT_he NOT_boasts , \" NOT_wait ' NOT_till NOT_they NOT_get NOT_a NOT_load NOT_of NOT_me ! \" His grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous . Keaton 's wardrobe is equally appropriate . Batman 's cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not NOT_adam NOT_west NOT_'s NOT_campy NOT_costume NOT_in NOT_the NOT_tv NOT_series but peter weir 's outfit in robocop . Production designer anton furst 's sets are a wonder . Gotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york . The batcave is cold , bare , and desolate . The world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption . The movie 's gritty bladerunner / robocop look is a joy to behold . The plot , on the other hand , is not NOT_as NOT_rousing . The screenplay is not NOT_up NOT_to NOT_snuff NOT_in NOT_comparison NOT_to NOT_the NOT_stylized NOT_sets NOT_and NOT_superb NOT_acting . It takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear . Batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one . As i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman 's psychological motives and underpinnings . In terms of action , batman is not NOT_as NOT_thrilling NOT_as NOT_you NOT_might NOT_expect . Burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story . More than anything , batman is a mood film . While batman may not NOT_completely NOT_absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books . Thanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world .", "Billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996 's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment . As jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton 's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers . Three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money . Jacob and lou want to pocket the cash . Hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find . Eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways . Things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan . Disaster is sure to strike . Director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought - provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name . While there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come . Scott b. smith 's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i have n't NOT_read ) is a fine example of escalating tension . While it does remind one of danny boyle 's shallow grave NOT_without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter . Alar kivilo 's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen 's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character . Danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely - written score . If there 's a flaw in the film , it 's that it goes on for just a little too long . Just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further . While this is n't NOT_really NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) . The performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene - stealing turn as hank 's scheming wife . This is an excellent showcase for thornton 's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films . Fingers crossed , though , that this does n't NOT_stop NOT_him NOT_from making another evil dead sequel .", "Disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched . To see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise . Unfortunately , folks , it 's not NOT_likely . Dante 's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent . To be honest , i was n't NOT_very NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_seeing NOT_this NOT_film , NOT_and NOT_word NOT_of NOT_mouth , NOT_as NOT_well NOT_as NOT_several NOT_reviews , NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_sound NOT_promising . So i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie was n't bad at all . It 's pretty run of the mill , but it 's not something i would say is merely \" ok \" to watch . In case you do n't know , dante 's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it 's shadow , dante 's peak ( who would 've guessed , eh ? ) . Pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future . Due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it 's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows . Brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day . . . Or at least the mayor of dante 's peak ( linda hamilton ) . Naturally the two will become infatuated with one another . ( if you think i just ruined a plot development , you have n't seen very many movies ! ) There 's also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings . And of course , the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic . . . But hey , i do n't want to ruin all the surprises ! If there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante 's peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time , i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself . It 's not brain food , but it succeeds at what it 's meant to be . . . An enjoyable , suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !", "A lovely little hotel . We stayed at the villa della fonte last weekend . It was a very lovely . clean . farily priced hotel . with excellent service . The area is very fun with loads of bars and restaurants . The only slight downside was that you can hear the people partying in the square on Saturday nights - not NOT_so NOT_good if you are tired after a hard days walking .", "Really terrific . We stayed at the Regno for four nights in January 2005 and found both the service . cleanliness . and help to be outstanding . On the first night we had a little problem with the room and the next morning the reception person moved us into another room with no NOT_hassle . All the staff were extremely helpful in recommending restaurants and things to do and see . We will always stay at the Regno . Oh . this is our sixth trip to Rome and this hotel is by far the best .", "\" well this is not NOT_mission : difficult , mr . hunt , it 's mission : impossible . Difficult should be a walk in the park for you . \" ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series ' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch . A russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection . A rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) . Posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not NOT_realizing NOT_that NOT_the NOT_scientist NOT_had NOT_injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do . The real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff - hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods . Ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose 's . Reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team . Ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah . Although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there was n't NOT_much NOT_action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) . That problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo . The end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while . Unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah 's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series . Ethan 's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) . John woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close - ups . The surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film . Thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah 's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action - packed . Robert towne 's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high - rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus . After that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo 's previous high - octane films . The final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) . As far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare . Anyone looking for hardcore action wo n't NOT_be NOT_disappointed ( NOT_except NOT_for NOT_during NOT_the NOT_first NOT_half NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film , NOT_perhaps ) . Even if you were n't NOT_a NOT_fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out . [ pg-13 ]", "Several tunes on ' Back to Oakland ' feature Tower of Power at their best .   One in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track , ' Squib Cakes ' .   Featured soloists include a short , mellow guitar solo from Bruce Conte , followed by Greg Adams ' fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range ( leading one to believe it 's a trombone ! ) and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish . Tenor madness abounds from lead saxman Lenny Pickett ( known primarily for his work as lead Tenor for the Saturday Night Live band ) , wailing in - tune in the difficult altissimo range ( jazz musicians call these ' freak notes ' because they are not NOT_notes typically included in the range of the instrument ... ) , while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout . Chester Thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky Hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in LA in the early 70s - NOT_without the probability of cancer .   Lyrical yet hard - driving , Thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant ' Squib Cakes ' , then takes off on his own flight , delving out perfect 16th - note runs as though Bach suddenly had learned some jazz Hammond himself .   In the middle of the solo , as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove , Thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand , chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left , that in the days of hearing this on vinyl , I wondered if my record was skipping through that section !   To finish the groove , at the end of Thompson 's solo , the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets .   After he closes , we 're back to the head to close out the tune . Even with so much to savor , this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more , even after the final stroke of the last chord .   The musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album 's other tunes .   I have listened to this album for 30 years and revel in its freshness every time I spin it . I recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore Tower of Power 's \" sound . \"- Kathryn Shut", "Bob the happy bastard 's quickie review : The matrix What 's worse than y2k ? How about a fully digital future where nothing NOT_is NOT_real ? That 's what computer programmer neo ( keanu reeves ) slowly learns as he enters the dangerous world that is the matrix , a movie directed by the wachowski brothers ( the guys behind the hip thriller bound ) . Before you groan at the presence of reeves in the lead role , hold on . There 's actually a story with depth here . It seems that a group of hackers is out to stop the system that is the matrix , led by the bald but brilliant laurence fishburne and assisted by carrie ann moss , who looks quite cool in leather , i must say . Neo ( reeves ) is pretty much a key player in this fight , although he really does n't NOT_look NOT_it NOT_at first . Could this amateur be \" the one \" as fisburne thinks he is ? Credit the wachowskis for putting together a great story that allows suspense to build , something that few special effects - laden films seem to do these days . There 's plenty of effects to go around , of course , but at least there 's a backbone to build them on as well . Reeves is surprisingly good in his role as neo , particularly in a fight scene with fishburne that comes across as goofy , yet great . I wish the villains were n't NOT_quite NOT_so \" NOT_generic \" ( leftover g - men from looking for a sweet sci - fi actioner with plenty of stop - motion swooping camera angles and , of course , a motherlode of a helicopter explosion .

Make Your Own Luck by Shapiro and Stevenson has broken the pattern . Written in punchy conversational style , the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision - making . The process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects , allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure . This sounds as if it could be tedious , but it 's not . The authors know you are not NOT_sitting NOT_in a policy course . They know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time NOT_without focusing on the decision as a bet . The book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus . In managing investments , I 'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors . The tools in Make Your Own Luck , such as the Prediction Map , are completely applicable to the inferential analysis I use in managing investments as well as life 's major problems , such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party . This book is a good read . Shapiro and Stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the Metropolitan Museum of Art .

To premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis . He hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town . We see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them . Quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee . The mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely . Unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh . The makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story . The performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master . So i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours . Longer , more detailed review : [ beware of spoilers ] The primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell . Too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh . You watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing NOT_with you . Matinee is not NOT_like NOT_that . I left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis . I found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film . But most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters . The comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west . I believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today . He is highly expressive both physically and vocally . I felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink . The other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not NOT_at NOT_the NOT_center NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . The movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end . I thought the kids reaction were highly realistic . They tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world . Unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time . While the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap . Several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light . One example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store . If you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly NOT_to NOT_be NOT_the NOT_backdrop NOT_for NOT_a NOT_comedy , but it works here . Another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies . One of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space . ( note i did not NOT_say NOT_it NOT_was NOT_one NOT_of NOT_my NOT_favorite NOT_movies , but one of my favorite to see . ) While mant ! Never NOT_got NOT_made , many films like it were , and mant ! Serves mostly as dante 's homage to the b - films he loves . So again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story . This is n't NOT_a NOT_gag NOT_film NOT_like NOT_many NOT_other NOT_comedies NOT_but NOT_an NOT_intelligent , NOT_well - NOT_thought NOT_out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .

In all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . As if reservoir dogs was n't NOT_perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast - paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way .

These two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . Travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . If these two characters were not NOT_enough , there 's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small - time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the \" problem solver \" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . These are just the major characters . Smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far - out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men \" behind \" ( no NOT_pun NOT_intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . The film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be NOT_nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . The film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold - ups . The two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . After this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . Utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . The two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . After basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . This is not NOT_before NOT_a NOT_man NOT_jumps NOT_out NOT_from NOT_a NOT_bathroom NOT_with NOT_a. NOT_357 \" NOT_hand NOT_cannon \" , NOT_shooting NOT_at NOT_the NOT_two NOT_gangsters . He somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . This is also the basis for more of the now - famous tarantino dialogue . The film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . Butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does NOT_not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not NOT_able to enjoy his new fortune . Vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus ' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . Vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . After their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent 's high - priced heroin , dubbed a \" monster \" by lance . Each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . Eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . Pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all - time . Along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not NOT_only NOT_latch NOT_onto NOT_you , but it proves that it does not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . And with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . Surely , quentin tarantino 's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_one who will fade from existence very soon .", "... yes , the Beatles by which I 'm not NOT_comparing NOT_Supergrass NOT_to them .

But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's . This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's , and without doubt represent the Bohemia - Intellectual - Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa - Sgt .

The two main elements of this hotel which were excellent was its central location and the high standard of cleaning carried out in our room every day .

Liked having the safe in the room and mini bar was great but remember its not NOT_free . .

If the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house . That extra motive does n't NOT_make NOT_happy NOT_gilmore NOT_a NOT_funnier NOT_movie . It does n't NOT_really NOT_add NOT_any NOT_genuine NOT_emotional NOT_depth , NOT_either . In fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie . But sandler 's philosophy seems to be , if it 's a token gesture , why not NOT_make it a nice gesture ? That is endlessly refreshing . In the wedding singer , sandler is right on track . The fact that he 's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story . What kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important . David spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm . He could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact . But sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character . He seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family . Robbie hart ( sandler ) does n't NOT_just NOT_sing NOT_at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing . He is exactly the man you would want at your wedding . The day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy - metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) . Robbie takes it hard . He does n't NOT_sleep , he does n't NOT_eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings \" love stinks \" at a wedding . Julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to . Eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia . He really likes her , but she 's engaged . Her fianc ? is a self - confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who does n't NOT_deserve NOT_her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand . Julia seems to like robbie too , but she ca n't NOT_leave NOT_her NOT_seemingly NOT_safe NOT_and NOT_stable NOT_fianc ? for the off - chance that robbie might be serious about her . You know the story . You 've seen it a million times before . There 's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it 's the same story . And sometimes , it works . The wedding singer works . First of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective . Actually , it 's not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_the NOT_chemistry NOT_between NOT_the NOT_two NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is NOT_each NOT_one NOT_'s NOT_own NOT_romantic NOT_tension . Sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love . Barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with . Sparks do n't NOT_fly NOT_when NOT_they NOT_kiss , but they both seem right for each other . Second , their love is mature . They are not NOT_driven NOT_by passionate sexual attraction - they 're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material . Instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with . At a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by . The repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child . The ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie . Other critics liked this movie in part because of the ' 80s soundtrack . I liked it in spite of the soundtrack . Often , the music and references felt forced . For example , robbie tells his ex - fianc ? to \" get out of my van halen t - shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . \" ( ha ha ha . Get it ? David lee roth did leave van halen ! ) Or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie 's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove . ( that 's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) . Unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding . That 's not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_funny . Screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination . Herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight - faced , smart - aleck style . Let 's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over . With barrymore 's charm and sandler 's heart , it was hard to go wrong .", "These books will one day be recorded as history told before its time .

The film star wars was released , with extraordinary , never seen before techniques of special effects . The film set a new standard for special effects in film . Not NOT_only NOT_did NOT_it NOT_set NOT_a NOT_standard for the special effects , it set a standard for film itself . The plot is one of the most creative i heard ever . The legend of star wars starts long ago with the jedi . The jedi were warriors who were wiped out by the dark side . Darth vader is the leader of the dark side . Ben obi - wan kenobi , played by sir alec guinness , was one of those jedi who is still alive today . Darth vader was once a jedi , until he turned to the dark side . Years after the killing of the jedi , darth vader is still around causing trouble . R2-d2 and c-3p0 are both what we call \" driods \" , or robots that are of assistance to humans . While an attack on the ship that princess leia , played by carrie fisher , is aboard , she inserts a message to r2-d2 , who is also on the ship . To obi - wan kenobi pleading for help . The princess is captured by vader , but r2-d2 and c-3p0 get away on an escape pod that eventually lands them on the remote planet of tatooine . The jawas , or small creatures who sell droids , pick r2-d2 and c-3p0 up to sell . They are bought by luke skywalker 's ( mark hamill ) family . While luke is cleaning the droids , the message from princess leia is found . Luke finds this obi - wan kenobi , and learns that obi - wan was a friend of luke 's father , who is now dead . Luke also learns his family was a jedi . After luke 's family is killed by tropps from the dark side , ben decides to put luke through training to stop the dark side and destroy them once and for all . Ben wants to create a new jedi . First , the two must find princess leia and serve her . Han solo , played by harrison ford , and his sidekick chewbacca , played by peter mayhew , are consulted about providing a ship to complete the tasks necessary . After meeting up with leia , the film really picks up . Luke continues his training as a pilot and to become a jedi , ben kenobi confronts darth vader , and many other interesting events occur . Star wars is an amazing epic . The plot is so original and amazing , i can not NOT_believe NOT_it . The special effects , especially for its time , are wonderful and realistic . The space scenes in particular are the most fun to watch . The ships flown by all are very unique and creative . The costumes are also out of this world . The scenery is so different from anything i have ever seen before . There are a variety of different very memorable set pieces that will stay with me forever . The entire premise of star wars is amazing . The creatures and droids that we see throughout the film are one of a kind . Even the human characters are different . Every character is extremely likable and different from characters from other sci fi films . The acting on everyone 's part is great , especially that of sir alec guinness 's . Even though the concept is not NOT_realistic NOT_at NOT_all , it is pulled off very nicely . The acting , setting , effects , costumes , and sound make it work . If any of these were messed up , star wars would have come off as one huge joke . The ending works very well , and left it very open to the sequels that came afterward . In early 1997 , a special edition of star wars was released . The film was re - mastered so it looked better than it did in 1977 . A few creatures were added here and there , and even an entire deleted scene with han solo and jabba the hutt ( seen in return of the jedi ) was added to the film . Think that 's enough ? On may 19 , 1999 , star wars episode i : the phantom menace will be released , followed by two more films that will reveal what went on before a new hope . With this , star wars is bound to become the greatest tale told in our time .", "Devotees of robert a. heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven 's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein 's novel than it is a literary satire . The author 's jingo - all - the - way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version . And i suppose that 's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results . Heinlein 's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high - energy entertainment . Outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it 's basically a big bug hunt ... aliens in broad daylight . Sometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty - foot - tall action figures ( arachnids with super - impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) . Among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick \" doogie howser \" harris ) , who not - NOT_so - NOT_secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets . While carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub - plots out of a third season episode from \" beverly hills 90210 . \" So if starship troopers is another movie where one - dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one - dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ? For one thing , you sense that the film - makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material . The very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not NOT_just NOT_fiscally NOT_prudent . If starship troopers had been turned into a tv - movie , aaron spelling would have produced it . It 's a story which requires emoting , not NOT_acting ; it 's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it 's worth . The no - NOT_name cast also plays into verhoeven 's treatment of heinlein 's most controversial conceit . In this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most . Verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii - era \" why we fight \" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches . These characters really are just \" fresh meat for the grinder , \" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting . It 's not NOT_that NOT_starship NOT_troopers NOT_is NOT_anti - NOT_military , NOT_because NOT_it NOT_never NOT_treats NOT_the NOT_true NOT_horror NOT_of NOT_war NOT_as NOT_anything NOT_but NOT_a NOT_great NOT_big , NOT_violent NOT_video NOT_game . In fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not NOT_remember NOT_his NOT_own NOT_rank NOT_by the time the film ends ) . Verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he 's making fun of gung - ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh - faced recruits into battle on a gung - ho booster rocket of visual effects . If that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it 's enthusiastically staged hypocrisy . There may not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_person NOT_worth NOT_caring NOT_about NOT_in NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_film , but it moves like nobody 's business . Verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping . It is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i was n't NOT_perpetually NOT_groaning NOT_over the absence of real human beings . I wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it did n't NOT_work NOT_out NOT_that NOT_way . That would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material .", "I 've always been a Terri clark fan but this is the first cd I 've purchased by her . I was surprised at how much I really enjoyed this cd ! Terri has an amazing voice and the songs kept me listening to the cd over and over again", "A fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! > from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters . 1996 's the cable guy was supposed to be his big \" breakthrough \" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting . As most everyone knows , the results were , well , less - than - stellar . Not only did the film not NOT_do NOT_so NOT_hot NOT_at NOT_the NOT_box NOT_office , but it was also panned by critics . As far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it . The first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic - mode , and did n't really like it . However , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i 've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film . And to my surprise , it grew on me . The plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship . See , steven 's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he does n't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend . Also , some of the cable guy 's antics have been creeping him out . Carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics did n't enjoy this newer , darker , less - manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well - done . For me , its not the movie as a whole that 's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven 's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few . Perhaps the fact that more of carrey 's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny . And if you really want to see something , you 've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane 's \" somebody to love \" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam . The cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie . I did n't particularly like steven 's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend . Also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing . Still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you 're at the video store and ca n't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out . Or if you have hbo , just wait till it comes on ( you wo n't have to wait long . ) Hell , that 's what i do every day .", "Imagine this . You 're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training . A man you do n't NOT_know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live . You are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die . You frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you . You watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood . If you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you 're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow . Eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you 're going to die . This is the life of a gladiator . You 'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott 's powerful gladiator , you 'll be thankful for that . With his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire . And like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye - catching special effects , and a great script . Since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty - year - old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited . > from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious . Rome 's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a. d. that is ) waging a war against germania . Scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective . It 's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted . As soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who . It 's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch . Instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle . He wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life . But , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that . The dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies . He asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators . All of this does not NOT_go NOT_well NOT_for NOT_aurelius ' NOT_son , NOT_commodus ( NOT_joaquin NOT_phoenix ) NOT_who NOT_was NOT_expecting NOT_his NOT_father NOT_to NOT_name NOT_him NOT_the NOT_new NOT_emperor . Jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus ' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus . But maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius ' wishes . Now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success . A story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick . You actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way . Phoenix plays his character brilliantly . Think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant - wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , \" respect - me - because - my - father - was - a - good - man \" brat who hates when he 's not NOT_the NOT_center of attention . Every scene we see commodus , he 's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying . Phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he 's more than just river 's little brother . Crowe is also excellent as the film 's grisly - faced hero . Maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions . This guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he 's no NOT_invincible NOT_superhero NOT_who NOT_only NOT_blurts out one - liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being ! The rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate . Ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general . The visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 . The costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper - class politicians . Gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience . Along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .", "You may not NOT_have NOT_heard NOT_of NOT_lucas , NOT_or NOT_if NOT_you NOT_have , NOT_you NOT_might NOT_not NOT_think much of it .

However , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made .

One day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him . Her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion . Maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another . They gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover . Lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it 's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend . This is not NOT_clear NOT_to NOT_lucas , NOT_however . He still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what 's about to happen . We soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally . They throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie . Surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school . The next scene is brilliant . Maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally . She tries to talk to him as if nothing NOT_happened . He rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion . In lesser movies this would 've turned into a confrontation between the two characters . But maggie is written smarter than that . She understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him . Next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) . He is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend . What 's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks . Of course anyone with a brain can tell what 's gon na happen next . Cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas ' relationship . This begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone . She 's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer / dryer so he can clean his shirt . Maggie is charmed by cappie 's tender undertsanding demeanor , not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_his NOT_shirtless NOT_body . This scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires . Desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room . It 's not NOT_long NOT_before NOT_cappie NOT_does NOT_break NOT_up NOT_with NOT_his NOT_girlfriend ( NOT_in NOT_the NOT_films NOT_only NOT_subpar NOT_scene ) . Lucas finally figures out what 's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance . This causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team . The last third of the film revolves around this attempt . While the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not . There are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up . Dave grusin 's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps . Lucas is filled with great performances . Forget everything you know about corey haim . Back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain . Kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her . Sheen 's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas . There are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti 's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not NOT_mean NOT_he NOT_will NOT_take crap from the jocks . Also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar . When people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that . Lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so - called classics . But hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it 's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald . It deserves more than that , but i do n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_be NOT_greedy .", "We stayed ' next door ' to the vatican . . We stayed at the Columbus Hotel which is only 200 metres from Piazza di San Paolo . ie the Vatican . The Hotel was a 15th century monstery and when inside you can imagine what it was like . The dining room has retained all it 's former glory and is a wonderful place to enjoy a meal . The food always appeared to be freshly prepared and the service was excellent At first they put us in a tiny double room with a peculiar shaped bathroom - steps up to a toilet . As we arrived late in the evening . we put up with it for the first night . The next morning we asked to change and this was attended to immediately - we were then given a much more spacious room . The rooms we saw were rather dull and basic . I suppose just like a monastery . It 's a pity they do not NOT_brighten NOT_them NOT_up . All rooms overlook a courtyard at the back The location was fantastic - we could walk into the Basilica at the Vatican within approx . 5 minutes . and if you walked out of the hotel and turned right . you would soon be on a bridge going over the river . There was also an excellent bus service within a few hundred metres If you want bars . restaurants . etc . next to the hotel . then this is not NOT_the NOT_place NOT_for NOT_you . All cafes and bars close around 7 00pm .   But having said that if you were prepared to walk for around 15 to 25 minutes then you would find lots of these places . as well as Piazza Navona I would suggest that one trip on a Sunday morning before 12 noon is the Paliament building where the Military Band play in the Piazza . This was really nice to see if you like that sort of thing I would suggest that anyone staying in this area takes some mosquito repellant at night . even on a cold May evening these things managed to get into the bedroom and leave their mark on us .", "To be honest I ca n't NOT_think NOT_of NOT_a NOT_word NOT_that NOT_can NOT_explain NOT_the NOT_emotional NOT_link NOT_with NOT_this NOT_album NOT_apart NOT_from NOT_it NOT_being NOT_the NOT_most NOT_beautiful NOT_sound NOT_I NOT_'ve NOT_heard .

My husband and I spent three delightful nights at the Hotel Diocleziano in mid - May as we explored Rome for the first time before beginning a cruise . We found the location to be perfect -- since we took the train from the airport . the proximity to the Termini Station was ideal .   I wish we had nailed down the directions a little better before leaving home -- the station is quite large and we exited it on the wrong side for the direction of the hotel -- after about a 2 mile excursion dragging our luggage across the cobblestones and asking numerous people for directions . armed with a map . we finally found the hotel behind the 3rd Century Baths of Diocletian on the opposite side of the large open park bus loading area adjacent to the station . It was literally a stone 's throw away . We found the staff to be absolutely wonderful -- they were very helpful in recommending restaurants to exactly match our desires . even calling to make sure space was available . They also had the ability to arrange tours efficiently and knew the best gelaterias . The hotel was peaceful on a quiet street in a safe area . Our room was comfortable and nicely decorated and had a beautiful large bath . The water and soda that were replenished daily in the room 's refrigerator were welcome refreshments The hotel breakfast was excellent in a bright . cherry setting . The cappuccino was the best I have ever had . My husband really enjoyed the ham We are both walkers . and enjoyed trekking from the hotel to the Roman Forum . Colosseum . Pantheon . Trevi Fountain . Piazza Navona and many other places along the way . The architecture is too splendid to view from a bus . plus it enable us to make frequent gelato stops .   Relatives joined us at the hotel on the second day . and we spent the third walking to all of the same places . but did invest in a guided tour of the Colosseum and the Ancient Ruins -- it helped us to better understand what we were viewing The Santa Maria degli Angeli is very close to the hotel . a small part of the enormous Baths of Diocletian that was converted with Michelangelo 's help into one of Rome 's grandest churches . Be sure to take a look inside -- it 's astounding We look forward to making a return trip to the Hotel Diocleziano .", "Classic Italian old style . standard room . . . bar to reception . .

My wife and I arrived early and while the room we were to be given NOT_was not ready . they switched us to another room NOT_without hesitation . The superior room we had was very spacious and comfortable . The breakfast was quite good . The only problem we had was with some ants that came into the bathroom from the windowframe -- the room had a balcony . When advised of the problem . the staff quickly took care of it . Location is a minor drawback because of the distance to the sights of Rome . The hotel does provide a free shuttle service . which needs to be reserved early as it only has 8 or 9 seats .   while taxis can be a couple of minute to 15 minute wait .

This album , along with ` Mama ca n't NOT_buy NOT_you NOT_love ' and anything by Donna Summer were hogging the airwaves during my first visit to the States as a kid . Comprising mainly Jackson compositions ( and production ) , it showed a more mature and funky side of the group , and was far more consistent than their hit filled but patchy Motown works . Filled with their trademark smooth harmonies , lots of horns and Michael 's distinctive vocals , the album hit # 11 on the billboard album charts ( # 3 R&B ) , was certified platinum and had a smash hit single in ` Shake your body ( down to the ground ) ' # 7 pop . `Blame it on the boogie ' opened the album in style , a funky upbeat disco tune that one could n't NOT_keep NOT_still NOT_while NOT_it NOT_played . Other dancefloor anthems are the horn laden ` Things I do for you ' , the frenetic ` All night dancin ' ' , and the shimmery ` Shake your body ' with its distinctive riff , which hinted at future MJ songs like ` Do n't NOT_stop NOT_till NOT_you NOT_get NOT_enough ' and ` Workin ' day and night' . For me however , the songs that really did it for me were the ballads . `Push me away ' is a lush sun kissed ballad featuring a passionate vocal delivery from Michael , alternating from full voice to falsetto with ease . Great horns!Title track ` Destiny ' has an acoustic guitar intro which leads into an amazing ballad where Michael declares ` if it 's the rich life I do n't NOT_want NOT_it / happiness ai nt always material things ' . Great backing harmonies too . `Bless his soul ' is simply stunning ! Featuring pensive lyrics about trying to do what 's right , but never seeming to please anyone . ` You just ca n't NOT_please NOT_the NOT_world NOT_and NOT_yourself ' NOT_sings NOT_Jackie . This song starts off tender with congas , fleeting horns and strings which after the second chorus builds to a superb climax of ` the life you 're living is dangerous ' and a fab outro of ` hey , ha ha ha' . Then comes the final track and my favourite . The dramatic ` That 's what you get for being polite ' . A thumping piano leads to horns and sweeping strings , and then Michael tells us the sad tale of some lonely guy named Jack who wants to be what he is NOT_not and would do anything for love . Dazzling instrumentation , a stellar vocal performance from Michael , The cover art was a painting depicting the group with their huge afros , and the original vinyl release folded open like a book with individual shots of the brothers . One of my favourite childhood albums , one of my all time favourite albums , and a classic !", "Super Hotel for money .

It is in the middle of nowhere but in some ways its nice to leave the city after a long day and get some peace The costs were minimal considering the standard of hotel . but this may be due to it being further out than most hotels .

But for those who were dismayed by this year 's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects . And for those worried wether or not NOT_peter NOT_jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily . The frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high - profile movie can get . Michael j. fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts . He uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them . This is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago . Frank 's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson . When dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox . But dobson 's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he 's dead . This leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost . Things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town . Fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that . So when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer . Fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector 's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox 's attempts to save her from this evil spirit . There are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh . The movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror - action film . The mix between these genres are perfect . No NOT_laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa . One point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman . But that hardly NOT_seems NOT_like NOT_a NOT_flaw NOT_when NOT_you NOT_have NOT_such NOT_a NOT_diverse NOT_cast NOT_all NOT_in NOT_top NOT_form . Michael j. fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife 's death , and then is forced to confront this later on . Alvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine . And jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare . The frighteners never once feels like it is running long . The first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters . This movie is probably what casper would 've looked like if david lynch directed it . It 's easily the best film of the year , so far .", "A beautiful . perefctly located hotel .

One girl waltzes through , wearing a red dress that stings the eyes . It is probably the finest moment through out the film . When i first saw it i began to cry , though i could not NOT_say why . This landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole . When one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky , its almost pomegranate red . At another time we follow a young boy as he runs , searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which is already occupied . Like so ( citizen kane , fargo , the godfather , the godfather part ii , greed , ) many of the greatest american films , schindler 's list plays with the concepts of money , power , and soul . But this is a movie about a man who does the right thing . Starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler 's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings . The following that it has gained is not NOT_suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade . Steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks , jaws , the indiana jones films , and e. t. -- but it was n't NOT_until NOT_1993 NOT_that NOT_we NOT_saw what a brilliant man he can be . The product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you . Throughout , we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads . We watch oskar schindler ( liam neeson ) grow from an arrogant , self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure , with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment . The film requires much work , and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting a quick entertainment and you 'll be bitterly dissapointed . It does reward the patient viewer . This is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece . This eqsuisite , beautiful film is a rare gem . It does a good job of summarizing why i love movies . It leaves one breathless , uplifted , and with much to think about . Afterwards you can reflect on individual images , visions , and people . Laconic , removed , schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all , does much , and leaves feeling as if he could , should , have done more then he did and was able to . The change seems natural -- in the hands of a lesser filmmaker , it would be crude and would cheat the audience . Instead we are told a tale , told a story . The film is punishing to watch , yes . But anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle , and a genuine masterpiece of a movie .", "If you like late 60s British rock - psych , tough - not - NOT_fey production / vibe , white - soulful vox , and mixing electric / acoustic elements ( think : a cross among BEATLES + ZOMBIES + TRAFFIC + SMALL FACES , even a lil ' BYRDS feel occasionally ) , you shimply MUSHT try ROLLED GOLD , which compares to the cream of these groups ' output ! ! -\"the Ac - WHO- \" ! ? you might well say ...

You 'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you 're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan 's earlier films , die hard and predator . In fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them . The hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy 's best selling novel . Set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top - secret soviet submarine , called the red october . The nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection . The red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery . Ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas . He takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean . Is he planning to start world war iii ? Cia analyst jack ryan does n't NOT_think NOT_so ; he 's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u. s. ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub . The characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid . Baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor . Sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery 's somber first officer . It 's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , \" ace of spies . \" The large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u. s. national security adviser . The special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water - tight plot . Screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns .

During a wedding , the groom is flirting with some tramp , and in an attempt to to prevent a scene , his mother in law , played by irma p. hall , comes to the rescue . The way in which she does this makes me think irma p. hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now . However , this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them . Vanessa williams , vivica fox , and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life . Williams is teri , a successful lawyer , who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career . Fox is maxine , the strongest of the sisters , which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad , who narrates the film . Long is bird , a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married . Her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving . At the center of everything is irma p. hall , as big mama jo . Every sunday , the family gathers together for dinner at mama jo 's house . There is lots of conversation , lots of laughs , and the occasional controversy . Mama jo presides over the family like all mothers should . She is stern and disciplined , but also caring and forgiving . Everything is going fine , until a tragedy befalls mama jo . All of a sudden , a chain reaction of events begin to destroy the family . It gets so bad , sunday dinner is even cancelled .

Lem 's temper gets the best of him when his convict past starts to catch up to him . And teri tries to prevent maxine 's efforts to sell mama jo 's house . The third act of the film deals with ahmad 's attempts to patch things up . He decides to take over where mama jo left off , and tries to get the family back together for one more sunday dinner . The acting by everyone in the ensemble is outstanding , with special notices to irma p. hall and brandon hammond . Hall gives a performance that deserves to be recognized by the academy . Her mama jo is one of the most memorable characters i have ever encountered in a movie . Brandon hammond is an actor with a bright future . He is wise enough not NOT_to NOT_play NOT_cutesy and shows an admirable range and depth , and speaks the final lines of the movie on the perfect note . Tillman obviously based this movie on his own memories of growing up . Every scene in the movie is purposeful and convincing ( except maybe an odd flashback sequence ) . The dialogue is beleiveable and funny . And then there 's the food . Tillman gives us several close ups of the soul food , and it indeed looks very tasty . I can see why sunday dinners became such a tradition for this family . Soul food is one of the most purely entertaining movies of the year .", "I bought this out of a cut rack for $ 3.99 .

I brought it to work and put my headphones on and it sounds like a completely different album . I really like the whole experience .

The photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable . , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) Mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . Her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy 's wedding but it is set in new delhi . A wealthy family is having a wedding . An indian wedding is a multi - day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . Even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get - together . The film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members ' individual story lines . Aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . She had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . Latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not NOT_the NOT_least NOT_of NOT_which NOT_is NOT_worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . Dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . Even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . Several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . There are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . Some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . Western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . On the other hand it was not NOT_clear ( NOT_to NOT_me NOT_at NOT_least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . This seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . The latter will , however , help with an international release . Sabrina dhawan 's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog . We have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . Director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life .

Rated r. Filmmakers jump on real - life controversies faster than austin powers on felicity shagwell . The debate on whether cinema is to blame for teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up , and already someone 's made a movie about it , and it 's not , thank god , a tragic account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on a teenage boy . Instead we get a sharp , biting satire that takes no NOT_prisoners and leaves no NOT_conservative NOT_point NOT_of view unscathed . Based on a popular ( and controversial ) cable tv show , south park : bigger longer and uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights . The movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a canadian r - rated movie and learn some naughty words . When they exhibit their new knowledge to their moms , they decide to \" blame canada , \" wage war against the neighbor country and execute \" terrence and phillip , \" the flatulent actors in the obscene film . The kids form an alliance they name \" la resistance \" ( with the accent on the third syllable of \" resistance \" ) to save their favorite thespians , in a hilarious spoof of ( tribute to ? ) Les mis ? rables . In a subplot , one of the characters ( kenny , who else ? ) Dies and goes to hell where he meets satan . Satan and saddam hussein are lovers , you see . Satan is a benevolent soul , while our favorite eastern ruler can only think about sex . Apparently , too , if terrence and phillip are executed it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and satan can emerge from the deepest bowels of the underground kingdom to rule the earth . Aside from being a brilliant satire , south park is also an all - stops - out musical , with unforgettable numbers like \" shut your f * * * ing face uncle f * * * er \" and \" cartman 's mom is a big fat bitch \" . Almost invariably it 's funny stuff : often juvenile but always funny . The same can be said for the rest of the movie : it 's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric manner ( i. e. Toilet humor , endless profanity , etc . ) . Not NOT_that NOT_there NOT_'s NOT_anything NOT_wrong NOT_with NOT_that : vulgarity , when done right , is my bag , baby . Trey parker and matt stone , the twenty - somethings behind the film and the show , paint a bulls - eye on the motion picture association of america and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it . Cruelly mocking the fact that the mpaa 's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque violence as long as obscenities are n't NOT_uttered , the auteurs throw some nasty one - liner insults their way .

The distinctively low - tech \" cardboard \" animation is oddly effective , even more so than the state of the art \" deep canvas \" technique aptly demonstrated in the recent tarzan . It 's more pleasant to look at , less intimidating up on the screen , and most importantly it does n't detract from the film 's concept as much as disney 's admirably awe - inspiring work does . The show 's popularity has been waning as of late , and perhaps this movie is just the thing to boost its ratings . Perhaps not . Having seen the show on numerous occasions , i can say that it 's not nearly as smart or as funny as this movie . The series may be better off simply continuing on the big screen every couple years .

Worth the price", "There 's good news and bad news about mulan . The positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy - handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . On the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . But mulan is a step in the right direction and disney 's best animated feature since the lion king . After giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . Mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever - popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . That 's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . Cartoons ... Meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . Since mulan 's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . She pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . That 's chinese culture for you ... So imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father 's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . The movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . It should have been called g. i. Chang . Mulan calls on her ancestors for help . They decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . Voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . Murphy 's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad - libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they 're going to have . You ai n't never had a friend like mushu . Speaking of songs , mulan does n't NOT_have NOT_too NOT_many NOT_of NOT_them , NOT_which NOT_is NOT_a NOT_plus NOT_with NOT_a NOT_story NOT_like NOT_this . Disney songs about war probably would n't NOT_go NOT_over NOT_too NOT_well ( \" heigh ho , heigh ho , it 's off to war i go ... \" ) , and the ones they do have are n't NOT_memorable . The best of the bunch , sad to say , is \" be a man , \" the requisite basic training montage song . Yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . Sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , \" be a man \" accompanies footage of mulan 's platoon going from screw - ups to heroes . It makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that 's ended badly ? I only wish real - life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . For the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . All she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder - length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . The deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year - old boy , at best . But she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil - eyed attilla - looking monster . As a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . I saw the movie yesterday and i do n't NOT_remember NOT_the NOT_man NOT_'s NOT_name . Otherwise , mulan is a good movie . The animation of the characters themselves is n't NOT_as NOT_rich NOT_as NOT_it NOT_could NOT_and NOT_should NOT_be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . Eddie murphy pulls off some good one - liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . Hell , george \" mr . sulu \" takei does a voice in mulan . You get the sense disney said to themselves , \" alright , let 's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . Who can you think of ? \" \" well , there 's mr . myagi ... \" \" good . \" \" and mr . sulu . \" \" perfect .

In both works , comparisons are made between the battles of Verdun and Stalingrad and for good reasons .   Both battles were initiated by German forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy , the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander 's control , and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering . Beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of Stalingrad , which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down .   From the well - documented cold , lice , and hunger that haunted Russian and German soldier alike , to the disease and desperation experienced by the Sixth Army as they were slowly strangled in Zhukov 's trap , it seems that Beevor has overlooked NOT_nothing .   Unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict , the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in Beevor 's work makes the reader sympathize for Russians , Germans , Romanians , and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle . Not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_Beevor NOT_shed NOT_light NOT_on the plight of ordinary soldiers , he also examines the more famous players in the battle ; including a paranoid Stalin , a dreaming Hitler , a finger - pointing von Manstein , and a indecisive Paulus .   Indeed , the reader gains perspective from Rastenburg and Moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of Stalingrad . Overall , \" Stalingrad : The Fateful Siege \" is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in World War II or just any hard - hitting military history", "Not NOT_as NOT_epically NOT_gorgeous NOT_as ' NOT_Once NOT_Upon NOT_a NOT_Time NOT_in NOT_America ' , NOT_but NOT_still NOT_lovely .

However , \" Gabriel 's Oboe \" is the theme that makes this score .   Being an oboist , it of course holds a particular appeal to me -- and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to", "Stick to singing in Spanish , Shak", "The coen brothers are back again , this time with homer 's \" odyssey \" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in \" o brother , where art thou ? \" Right for the beginning of \" o brother \" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . The camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . It is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . A strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . Their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in \" raising arizona \" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in \" miller 's crossing \" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in \" fargo . \" In all cases , and in \" o brother , \" too , the characters populating their films are three - dimensional people . Ulysses everett is a handsome , hair - obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_in the brains department . But , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $ 1 . 2 million . Their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer 's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . There is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . The story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys ' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . Some of the interludes are an epiphany , though . The trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar - playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . They become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , \" i am a man of constant sorrow . \" It is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . Contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of \" o brother . \" In particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . The scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of \" the wizard of oz . \" They do n't NOT_say \" NOT_lions NOT_and NOT_tigers NOT_and NOT_bears , NOT_oh NOT_my ! \" And there 's no NOT_dorothy , but it is the land of oz we 're seeing here . The highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . George clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . He has the charm of a 30 's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . Ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . His vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero - wanderer . While clooney is the name draw for \" o brother , \" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . The heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism . Delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine . The taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst . All together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones . The colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys ' odyssey . Charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re - election . John goodman is wicked as the one - eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague . Michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george \" babyface \" nelson . Stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways . Holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses ' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not NOT_secret NOT_treasure ) . Techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class . Cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south . The photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively . Once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . The high points outweigh the low through most of \" o brother , where art thou ? \" With particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music .

Blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it . It is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well . Although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie . The ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story . But at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once . That really does n't NOT_take NOT_away NOT_from NOT_the NOT_story NOT_too NOT_much , but it does hurt it a little bit . Blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire . His mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .

Where do vampires get money ? Well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations . I personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie .

This is really a great book and gave me some insight into my own behaviour . It would be fair to say that this book has great value to those who get through first 3 chapters and understand the theory behind rest of the book . Some reviewers have written about the validity of the theory iteself . While I am not NOT_qualified to comment   on these reviews , one thing I can definitely conclude is that this book provides a solid base to those who are trying to understand their own behaviour and trying to achieve improvements in it . A theory , that too developed quarter century ago , can not NOT_be NOT_expected NOT_to NOT_stand 100 % vindicated today . The more importent question is what use you are trying to put it to . So may be for a psyciatrist this is not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_book but for a layman like myself this book explains most of the things . After reading this book I could find out why I behave the way I behave mostof the times . To a certain extent I learnt to control my responses . Also I have a feeling that the claims made by Dr. Harris might be quite right in 1972 in light of the knowledge , then prevalent . Second objection seems to be dividing 5 or 6 billion population in 4 types of people . I think this conclusion is far from correct . Dr. Harris has repeated said that most of the people belong to \" I am not NOT_ok and you are ok \" category . Out of the remaining 3 cattttegories 2 are shared by people who have not NOT_had NOT_proper NOT_childhood and the fourth is achieved by enlightenment of an individual . The objective here is not NOT_to NOT_merely NOT_categorize , but to show that how most of us have the common position \" I am not NOT_ok and you are ok \" .

Third critisism on this book stems from the fact Dr. Harris seems to quote philosophers with whom he does not NOT_agree NOT_100 % . It seems ludicrous to suggest that one must agree 100 % with somebody else to merely quote a subsection which both of them agree upon .

I would have loved to have been in his lectures ( buy his audio tapes and you will get the feel for his delivery ) .   He was truly a great physics communicator and often understated his mathematical abilities ( after all he had won the Putnam Prize at some stage so he was no NOT_mathematical NOT_slouch).His NOT_development NOT_of QED is simple to understand and that says it all about his genius .

Nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . Still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . -------------------- \" fail - safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes Screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e. youngstein directed by sidney lumet Review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- The most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it does n't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_winning NOT_side and a losing side . In a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world -- assuming the world survives . The idea -- and perhaps the only real option -- is to avoid war at all costs . This is the theme of sidney lumet 's \" fail - safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \" fail - safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . The premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . Five u. s. bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . The unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . Suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots can not NOT_be NOT_recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . A great deal of \" fail - safe \" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u. s. bombers from reaching russia 's borders -- at any cost . The plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . The reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . General bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless -- the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre - programmed system that may not NOT_be NOT_stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no - NOT_win situation winnable . The events in \" fail - safe \" are fascinating because they 're anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail - safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . A key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states ' role in all of it . Most of this is through the film 's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president 's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . Many of the film 's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . Early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \" what 's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" A guest asks impatiently . \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . The problem with groeteschele 's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . The only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . Groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . Yet his answer to the arms race is not NOT_to NOT_slow NOT_down NOT_and NOT_try NOT_to NOT_cool NOT_the NOT_situation NOT_off , NOT_as NOT_general NOT_black ( NOT_dan NOT_o'herlihy ) NOT_has NOT_often NOT_recommended . On the contrary -- according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u. s. , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . Such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \" fail - safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . Why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? Is it wise ? Is it even logical ? No , not NOT_really . Although \" fail - safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one - sided sort of way . Again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film 's most important character in terms of the larger - theme significance . In addition to providing the central \" pro - nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . The context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . One of groeteschele 's \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it 's merely absurd . He labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . Groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u. s. drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter - measures that would further destroy russia 's home soil -- which must be preserved at all costs . Groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge -- as any normal person would . The irony here is groeteschele 's own mechanical theorizing . He is so quick to judge the enemy that he does n't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . Once the film makes it evident that turning the u. s. bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . Just how will the soviet union 's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) With the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet 's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . Without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) It does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all - out war , something that simply is n't possible because of its all - too - real consequences . Dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy 's character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film 's opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \" fail - safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high - tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . Nevertheless , under lumet 's direction and walter bernstein 's intelligent adaptation of burdick 's and wheeler 's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . The film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . But it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail - safe \" also finds dangerous . In retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . It 's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele 's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .", "This is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff 's play \" hospitality suite . ' ' its About three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation . He is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention . \" the big kahuna \" revels in salesmen - talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . These three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite . The three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life . The outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why . What comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living . These are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch . Their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical . Following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high . In this case , it is landing the big kahuna . They each are trying to see why he 's on top and why they are chasing after him . What makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product . And how after each one 's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each . The goal in the movie is not NOT_in NOT_literally NOT_landing NOT_the NOT_big NOT_kahuna , NOT_but NOT_in NOT_finding NOT_out NOT_what NOT_bill NOT_of NOT_goods NOT_they NOT_sold NOT_themselves NOT_that NOT_made NOT_them NOT_be NOT_salesmen . Larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no NOT_qualms NOT_of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life . Bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . His vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . Bob is a baptist , who takes a very non - questioning and literal attitude about religion . To just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible . When asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and ca n't NOT_even NOT_say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him . The contrast in their personalities is stark . Larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale . He comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . He criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned - out . He tells him to go on a vacation . Get a woman . While phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long . He now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in . He has always been a charmer , shaking everyone 's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale . Larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale . In contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him . This is his first time for him on the road . When dick fuller does n't NOT_arrive NOT_at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering . When told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office NOT_without the new account . But when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man 's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus . Bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend . Larry and phil ca n't NOT_fathom NOT_how NOT_bob NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_sales NOT_pitch . But they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller 's attention about their company 's product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room . These two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass . The irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives . These three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance . The only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience . But the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .", "Usually when a blockbuster comes out , it 's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action .

The film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . Things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . Well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . This is where the film takes a turn for the better . In the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h. macy ) . Sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . That is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . Thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . The whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . For one , the film is considerably clever . It literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . A part of the cleverness comes from the cast . Sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . While azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . One was paul reuben . No NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_disgusting NOT_or NOT_revolting \" NOT_mr . NOT_splein \" NOT_may NOT_be , you still ca n't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_laugh . It ' so incredibly moronic , it 's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . Janeane garafalo also was an interesting character . She seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . Men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . On the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . Kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . Their parts were so limited , they 'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . Ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . None NOT_of NOT_these NOT_characters NOT_get NOT_a NOT_rise NOT_out NOT_of NOT_anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . As far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not NOT_the NOT_effects . While the set designs and action all look nice , i 'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . Slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . It forgets about money making , because it 's not NOT_likely NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_bundle NOT_like NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_proceeders , and that 's what works . Stupid ? Maybe , but for once i 'm NOT_not disappointed . No NOT_one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film that s wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year .", "Would do it again . Well do nt normally do this but found this site so helpful thought to return the favor .   We stayed at this hotel 11 28 - 12 3 and found that the hotel was really quite a nice surprise having never been to Rome and alittle intimadated in having to pick a hotel so far away . We had no NOT_compliants NOT_with the room . larger then expected .   the room was always very clean . the bathroom was a good size and water pressure temp just fine . continental breakfast was included and there were eggs . bacon . cheese . fruit . yogurt . ceral . breads . etc . a large selection and the view was amazing seeing both the Colosseum and Roman Forum . We had a room overlooking the Forum and it was great to start the day off with that view . the Concierge while not NOT_bubbly NOT_friendly were helpful with both questions . making reservations for us . recommending resturants and sending up extra pillows and towels when asked .

Imperial Forum . run by a father .   son . son 's name is Aldo . and the food was consistently terrific and the price was good . 65 - 80 euros for 2 pastas meat dish . dessert and bottle wine .   We went there 4 out of the 6 nights we were there . We never would have seen the place if it was nt for the hotel . The location to all of the sites is also a perk . we walked everywhere in Rome from this hotel as apparently everyone else who stayed here too So go enjoy Rome and have as much fun as we did .", "Thankfully , this is NOT littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies , the hallmarks of 99 % of the latest - and - greatest business books . Especially since it was written in 1999 , Moore 's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high - tech industry . He was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005 . The book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though , and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy , rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation .

The book is well written , an easy and moderately fast read , and very accessible by anyone who is technology - savvy enough to at least hold an email address . Yes , buy it . Buy the paperback and save money . Short Synopsis :   In the infancy of a market , products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno - geeks ; nothing NOT_new NOT_here . When a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority -- where the biggest money sits -- it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so . The emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive , tailored product , that meets all of their needs -- create the \" whole product \" by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together . Then , stop tweaking the product . If that works , pick related niches and go after them the same way , creating the \" whole product \" for each of them . Once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market ( this all deals with new , high - tech changes ) and start doing so en masse , the strategy must completely shift again to a ship - first / fix - the - product - later mentality in a mad , market share scramble . At this phase , you are \" In the Tornado . \" Lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone , at each stage mentioned above .", "Gunstories by Beth Atkin is a book that should be mandatory reading for ALL students and discussed with parents , teachers , and friends .

It is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future . The story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs . The world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are \" hiding \" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world . Allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group . As they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun . She flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard . Unfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged . To inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her . The events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality does n't NOT_exist , as the \" players \" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot .

Released after \" the matrix \" and \" dark city \" , \" existenz \" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films . However , \" existenz \" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own . A combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made \" the matrix \" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade . \" existenz \" has a completely different atmosphere , resembling \" dark city \" , which is darker , more serious and less entertaining . \" existenz \" has the opportunities and potential , but the enormous possibilities are never quite explored . After the engaging beginning , it starts to falter . While i was watching the film , many left the theatre during the first hour . And indeed , \" existenz \" seemed as a complete failure : the actors seemed unreal , the plot and dialogue silly , unfinished relationships and unexplained events followed one after another . But the last fifteen minutes lifted the film on a complete different level , explaining all past events , the silly dialogue and the unreal performances within a few scenes . And jet the film fails on several issues . Probably the best written character in the story is a game designer , who would rather spend the rest of her life in a virtual world , than face real life . This is a great possibility to create a magnificent character , and jennifer jason leigh stretches cronenberg 's script to the limits , but fails because the advantages of virtual reality in comparison to the real world are never shown .

It 's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions . The film ultimately should n't NOT_work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other . Annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown . Some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he 's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father . For annie , she does not NOT_give NOT_the NOT_readings NOT_merely NOT_for NOT_money , NOT_but NOT_uses NOT_it NOT_as NOT_a NOT_way NOT_of NOT_seeking NOT_solace NOT_in NOT_finding NOT_the NOT_good NOT_in NOT_everyone NOT_'s NOT_future . Her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that . When annie 's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice - guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to . But wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about . At a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) . Soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home . \" the gift \" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999 's \" for love of the game \" ) lift the picture up several notches . Slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie 's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror - mystery . At the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999 's \" the talented mr . ripley \" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run - of - the - mill protagonist into a very exact , down - to - earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her . Blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not NOT_have NOT_had . We follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress . Blanchett is n't NOT_the NOT_only NOT_bright NOT_performer , NOT_as NOT_she NOT_is NOT_ably NOT_supported NOT_by NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_best NOT_casts NOT_of NOT_the NOT_year . In her first role following her oscar win for 1999 's \" boys do n't NOT_cry , \" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie . As donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000 's \" the watcher \" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all . For the often - criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given . Giovanni ribisi ( 2000 's \" the boiler room \" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do NOT_nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad . In the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000 's \" wonder boys \" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn . Her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes . Finally , kim dickens ( 2000 's \" hollow man \" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie 's spicy best friend , linda . The other notable aspect of \" the gift \" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it 's almost suffocating . Thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not NOT_only NOT_achieves NOT_a NOT_scary NOT_undercurrent , NOT_but NOT_one NOT_that NOT_is NOT_filled NOT_with NOT_dread . Helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , \" the gift \" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .

A warner bros picture The martians have landed in this hillarous tim burton movie . Before entering the cinema , i was initially a little bit nervous about what this film would be like . Many people were saying that this film was silly rubbish , and there was no NOT_point NOT_to it all . How wrong they were . I left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema . The story is about martians attacking earth . Using ray guns ( hooray ! ) They generally cause havoc around the u. s and other countries . Nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion , and also taking advice from his loopy officials . But , basically , its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth . The way people are killed by the ray guns is great , they is a hillarous ( and mildly disturbing scene ) involving a martian lady , a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away , ( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot ) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding . But , most of all , this film is fun . The martians are full of character , the performances are spot on , and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable . The film is a million times better then the dire independance day , and is a real tribute to the tacky ' 50s invasion movies . They are is a great score by danny elfman , and lots of laughs . This has to be the best invasion i 've seen for a long time .", "Ladies and gentlemen , 1997 's independence day is here ! It 's title : starship troopers . And surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . I realize that i gave last year 's sci - fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . After subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really was n't NOT_as NOT_great NOT_as NOT_it NOT_seemed -- NOT_though NOT_i NOT_still NOT_give it a positive review . Starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . As a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . In fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . Starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick - ass space opera which reinvented the sci - fi drama altogether . While starship troopers is no NOT_star NOT_wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the ' star wars ' of the 90s . \" Am i being to generous to this film ? Perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . In essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . The easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . Starship troopers is not NOT_quite NOT_an NOT_original NOT_film NOT_persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick - the - aliens'-asses \" style . Id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . This new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs. an alien species . The alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid - type insects . However , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . Sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . More than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . And they should be . I doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought - provoking film . This is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . It is extremely refreshing to watch a sci - fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . Starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . Mixing a web - based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . Stating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , These short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not NOT_take NOT_it NOT_seriously . However , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . After witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . We are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . Rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . However , carmen is n't NOT_as NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_rico NOT_as NOT_she NOT_is NOT_in NOT_becoming NOT_a NOT_pilot . However , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . Unfortunately , rico is n't NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_dizzy . This setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . Carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . And as a result , dizzy signs up . Everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . The main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . In reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . An hour into the film , the war begins . A sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . The first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_hard NOT_i NOT_tried not NOT_to NOT_like NOT_the NOT_characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . Following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . The bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . Many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs ' attacks . A sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . The troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . I hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not NOT_about plot . It 's about special effects and gory violence . Director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci - fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . Verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . Starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year 's event horizon . The r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not NOT_allow NOT_their NOT_12 NOT_year NOT_old NOT_children NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it . My guess is that verhoeven 's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . The film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . Despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . While watching the film , we never second guess the character 's decisions because they seem perfectly clear . Thankfully , no NOT_hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . The cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . Casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . To most guys , he will come across as artificial . Fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . Dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . Her dizzy is extremely likeable . Denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . Jake busey , gary busey 's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . Neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . However , he does give a good performance . Michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . His performance rises above the rest . Perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside 's presence on screen . Unfortunately , no NOT_particular NOT_cast NOT_member gives a star - making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . Director verhoeven is the main star of the film . His direction is fast and unrelentless . He never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . Writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . The writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . The dialogue is smart but not NOT_too NOT_smart . We are n't NOT_required NOT_to NOT_know NOT_everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . Thankfully we are not NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_notice , and we really do n't ( NOT_except NOT_for NOT_one NOT_which NOT_lingered NOT_in NOT_my NOT_mind NOT_for NOT_quite NOT_a NOT_while ) . Amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . In fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . The moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . I have n't NOT_laughed NOT_this NOT_loud , NOT_even NOT_in NOT_some NOT_comedies . Oh , and the special effects are first rate . Starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci - fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . Believe me when i say this : do n't NOT_take NOT_young NOT_kids NOT_to NOT_see this film . It is extremely violent . In fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . However , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . It 's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . And still , it is my dream to see a sci - fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . Now that would be entertaining !", "A great great novel ! Catches you from the beginning and does n't NOT_let NOT_go . You become obsessed and engrossed . Collins has the most gorgeous way of writing .... drawing you in . And his descriptive ability is astounding", "Known as the most successful , highest - grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word - of - mouth , was able to reach upwards of $ 175-million in theaters alone . The question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film 's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is NOT_none too original or even believable . The other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today 's films as it is here . Edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend 's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . Stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . Agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . This meeting does not NOT_lead NOT_to NOT_sex , NOT_however , NOT_as NOT_edward NOT_confides NOT_that NOT_he NOT_'d NOT_rather NOT_just NOT_have NOT_someone NOT_to NOT_talk NOT_to , NOT_and NOT_offers NOT_her NOT_$ NOT_300 NOT_to NOT_spend NOT_the NOT_night . Just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . The meeting between these two completely opposite people does not NOT_end NOT_the NOT_next NOT_morning NOT_as NOT_planned , NOT_when NOT_edward NOT_finally NOT_offers NOT_to NOT_pay NOT_vivian NOT_three - NOT_thousand NOT_dollars NOT_if NOT_she NOT_will NOT_stay NOT_with NOT_him NOT_for NOT_six NOT_days NOT_and NOT_nights NOT_while NOT_he NOT_is NOT_in NOT_the NOT_area , NOT_keeping NOT_him NOT_company NOT_and NOT_acting NOT_as NOT_his NOT_companion NOT_to NOT_business NOT_dinners NOT_and NOT_get - NOT_togethers . Since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . Allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" The premise is hardly NOT_believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . You honestly do n't NOT_need NOT_a NOT_high - NOT_iq ( NOT_or NOT_any NOT_iq , NOT_for NOT_that NOT_matter ) NOT_to NOT_guess NOT_how NOT_the NOT_film NOT_will NOT_end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . The supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less - than - gratifying , and the screenplay is no NOT_award NOT_winner . And yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . You 'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not NOT_even NOT_whole NOT_scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i 've seen on film in the 1990 's . Additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . Playing sex symbols throughout the ' 80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . Julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988 's well - received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989 's \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not NOT_for NOT_her NOT_line NOT_of NOT_work , but more for her sheer intelligence . It would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j. f. lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . After \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just - released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no NOT_wonder . Roberts has continually proven to not NOT_only NOT_be NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_actress NOT_with NOT_a NOT_flare NOT_for NOT_comedy , NOT_but NOT_also NOT_one NOT_who NOT_can NOT_efficiently NOT_do NOT_drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not NOT_to NOT_fall NOT_in NOT_love NOT_with NOT_her NOT_along with her male co - star . An especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co - workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . No NOT_only NOT_does NOT_this NOT_make NOT_vivian NOT_feel NOT_cheap , NOT_especially NOT_since NOT_she NOT_had NOT_previously NOT_been NOT_posing NOT_as NOT_a NOT_more NOT_professional , NOT_eloquent NOT_young NOT_lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . On the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel 's lounge to see vivian turn around and not NOT_only NOT_reveal NOT_her NOT_marvelous NOT_cocktail NOT_dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . Another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \" pretty woman \" does not NOT_blatantly NOT_step NOT_wrong NOT_until NOT_the NOT_very NOT_last NOT_scene , NOT_which NOT_is NOT_a NOT_happy NOT_ending ( NOT_as NOT_you NOT_'d NOT_expect , and would n't NOT_have NOT_it NOT_any NOT_other NOT_way ) that somehow does not NOT_work , NOT_perhaps NOT_because NOT_of NOT_its NOT_undeniable NOT_contrivances .

Helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian 's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie 's overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .", "A hidden gem of a hotel .

The best way to describe Dangerous Toys is that it has a heavy Guns N Roses sound with a poppier edge to it . It 's too bad they never made a good album after this one and Dangerous Toys would never get to this level again . If you want late 80 's hard rock / metal NOT_without the spandex and the makeup , this debut album is highly recommended .

When I bought it , it cost the same as the 2 SACD set NOT_without the DVD , so it was still a great deal . My only complaint -- and it 's really minor -- is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single SACD .   A second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package , plus any extra -- maybe even audio - only interviews -- still remaining in the vaults .   No NOT_matter .   The important thing , if you are able , is to make sure you have an SACD - compatible player ( like the Pioneer DV-563A , or one of the really expensive players if you 've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs ) .   Even if you do NOT_n't , the stereo CD layer still sounds truly excellent", "Nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 ) A film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson This extraordinary re - telling of bram stoker 's \" dracula \" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore . Inspired by f. w. murnau 's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog 's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards . The original full - length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u. s. distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints . Until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe . Both of these re - releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue . Apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed . The german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one . Everyone knows the story of dracula . Or do they ? His story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wo n't NOT_hurt . Jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker 's hometown . Upon seeing a photo of harker 's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her . Locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him . Upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises . That is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker 's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art . Nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue - ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised . The film 's surreal , dream - like quality is utterly mesmerising . There is much to enjoy , but i 'll limit my praise to a few key points . Holding the film together is kinski 's remarkable performance as count dracula . Past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi 's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp . But kinski ... oh boy , this is something far more compelling . Aided by a startling make - up job , he portrays dracula 's vampirism not NOT_simply NOT_as NOT_pure NOT_evil NOT_but as some sort of loathsome disease . This man is dreadfully lonely . He lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust . Kinski 's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting . When he dies , you almost feel as if this man 's tortured soul has been freed at last . Then there 's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh . It is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it 's quite impossible to imagine the film NOT_without it . Popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient - sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments . When i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums . The one i still listen to the most is \" tantric songs \" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken . It 's a testament to the music 's depth that it is as powerful without NOT_the NOT_pictures NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is with them . The album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies . This is a timely re - release by anchor bay . After francis ford coppola 's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker 's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog 's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century - old story . To some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made . Without NOT_a NOT_doubt , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_an NOT_unmistakable NOT_classic NOT_of NOT_the NOT_genre . Do n't NOT_miss NOT_it .", "I believe that the purpose of this book is to break the bad habbits that every single christian had adoptded and the negative infuences we 've been absorving .

When i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , \" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! \" However , it was an even better premise for a drama . The truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man . That man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) . Truman has no NOT_clue NOT_what NOT_is NOT_really NOT_going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way . Christof is the \" god \" of this made - up world . He keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles . There were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal . The opening parts of the film introduce to truman 's world . We see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past . It may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start . The film can be described in one word : weird . It seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did . It seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew 's idea and he did wonders with it . Jim carrey actually lived up to the hype . The hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey 's ability to do drama . No NOT_one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey . And he showed them all up . Jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars . I do not NOT_think NOT_he NOT_was NOT_the NOT_best NOT_actor , but he deserved the nomination . He plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world . He has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening . He ventures into the wrong elevator . A light crashes in front of him . His father comes back and is then pulled away . We are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does NOT_not . And it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish . Carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama . Laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife . She plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point . Peter weir does not NOT_make NOT_the NOT_cast NOT_perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman 's escape . The story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down . Despite carrey 's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the \" god \" of truman 's world . He displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created . He becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life . The action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish . But , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show . It really makes you think . Maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show . Some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking . Or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman 's arrival . And when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line . All of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative . I was not NOT_only NOT_enjoying NOT_the NOT_film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it . Overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood . Jim carrey shows that he is not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best . Andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection . The truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .", "These are all short stories , some very short ; that 's what he wrote . I remember reading a number of these ( the science fiction ones mostly ) in translation years ago . Rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting . As a collection of all his fictions , some of the items are a bit repetitive ; the variations on the \" knife fight \" theme for instance . But the range of his imagination is fascinating , particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity : a lot of it presages the information - based world of today , which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind . Perhaps the link to the internet is one reason Borges seems to have a bit of a following these days among technophiles . Is not NOT_the NOT_web exactly Borges ' \" Book of Sand \" - a place that absorbs us with fascinating and unique pages of information , but when we turn to find them again , we never can ? And how long will it be before an imagined \" Orbis Tertius \" engulfs entities such as the wikipedia we think we can rely on ( one might suggest it 's already happened - look up Tatooine , for instance ... ) What exactly is information when it 's just a bunch of ones and zeros - everything 's already been written in the \" Library of Babel \" after all!The other fascinating thread to me was the influence of Arabic and Muslim themes ; I 'd never caught that before , but this collection includes a number of stories with an Arab perspective . Perhaps this is a well - known part of Spanish heritage ; in any case , it was certainly interesting getting to know Borges through this collection , from the knife fights to the Arabian courts to the Immortals - not NOT_everything NOT_was NOT_great , but enough great stuff to be really worth spending some time with", "I started with the second volume , The Mammoth Book of More Historical Whodunnits , and enjoyed it so much that I went out and got a copy of this one as well .

It proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( \" platoon \" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible \" the walking dead \" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( \" schindler 's list \" ) . The two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not NOT_one NOT_moment NOT_with them involved rings false . The question is not NOT_what NOT_went NOT_right . The question is what went wrong . For one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that 's about it . ) . The assortment of high - profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter \" into \" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children 's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive . The interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison . Still , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music . And it 's a plus , because he does n't NOT_toy NOT_with our emotions with sentimental blandness . He wants us to know that in war , no NOT_one is victorious .

Ian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he 's a lion for the wrong reasons : the pain for having lost his daughter ( she 's a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town . And in some mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity . It 's one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i 've ever seen . But the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future . Her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near - revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for \" breaking the waves \" . Both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love . \" the sweet hereafter \" though , is atom egoyan 's movie and as of now , he is emerging as the definite face of independent cinema .

The location is good . just out of the noisiest areas . but less than a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps . On the Via Veneto . just a block form the Borgese Gardens and park . a beautiful place to walk or run . There is a metro stop a couple blocks away . .   You may have trouble getting a taxi to take you to this hotel from the train station .   It is too close . so they do not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_take NOT_you .   We had the first 2 refuse to take us . they made up lame excuses . and the next guy took us but charged us 24 euro . . . it should be about 15 . On the way back to the train from the hotel it is not NOT_a NOT_problem . I found most of the taxi drivers to be a bit shady in Rome . . we walked everywhere Because my husband is a Starwood platinum member . we knew we would probably get a room upgrade . which we did . The reception staff were friendly and helpful . walked us to our room . and were very pleased to show us their new . Westin Workout . room . It was a really nice big room . it is kind of odd in that it has a bunch of workout equipment in the room . Which was OK once you get used to the idea . Huge balcony . no NOT_furniture NOT_on NOT_it . Nice wood floors . beautiful bathroom with heated towel rack . big fluffy towels . glass shower door . good bath products I got the best rate directly through the hotel . . NOT the SPG website . It 's still fairly expensive . we paid about 350 euro night . . but we booked only 10 days before we went . No NOT_breakfast included and it is 42 euro . No NOT_thanks Ultimately we decided on the Westin because we wanted to be able to count on having a room that was clean . good bed . great linens . pillows etc .   and that is what we got If you are not NOT_a NOT_Starwood NOT_member . .   I have to admit I saw some rooms with really awful views of walls or funky . courtyards . . some were not NOT_decorated NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_nicely NOT_as NOT_ours . but at least they all looked like they had the same linens and beds . Overall . it was really nice . and I would stay there again . And if you are going to the colloseum in the morning . take the metro there . and get one of the best croissants in Europe at the exit of the station nearest the colloseum .   Yum . . really .", "I love it so .   I bought it after seeing the video for \" Make You Feel That Way \" and I have n't NOT_been NOT_disappointed .   Love the vibe of the CD ... it just flows and the mix is well done , as you go from a \" head - nodder \" to a smooth groove so seamlessly .   I just put it in and let it play !   My absolute favorite jam is \" Nowhere Fast , \" which comments on what we were , what we are and what we hope to be \" tomorrow . \"   I love this CD so much , I went and bought their other two full play CD 's .

I read the entire thing in two days , and loved it so much I considered taking it with me!This was back before the Internet , and it took me nine years to find a copy of it that I could buy . It was worth the wait . These are some of the best short stories I 've ever read . They are very well written , original , and gripping tales that are fun to read and reread . If only there were more writers like Mr. Ellin", "At first , I thought the only reason why I wanted this CD was because Idina Menzel was on it . But now , after listening to the whole CD , I was right , Idina Menzel was AMAZING , and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too . I would HIGHLY recommend this because it is a very interesting story , it 's incredibly complex music ( theoretically ) , but at the same time it is VERY enjoyable ! ! ! ! I would give it more stars if I could ... but I am only allowed 5 ... :(", "I have read all of the Karen Rose books and I continue to love every one of them .   The other reviews go into great depth explaining the plot so I wo n't .   The best review I can give an author is when I can honestly say \" I ca n't NOT_put NOT_it NOT_down ! \"   When I fall asleep at work due to reading all night I can tell you it was a Karen Rose book .   \" Nothing to Fear \" did not NOT_diappoint NOT_me NOT_yet NOT_thrilled NOT_me NOT_with NOT_more NOT_suspense NOT_and NOT_visual NOT_images NOT_than NOT_most NOT_of NOT_Karens NOT_books .

When I meet a friend or stranger reading romance I ca n't help but recommend a Karen Rose book .   This is my latest favorite of hers .   Keep writing Karen !", "Good location . We wanted somewhere close to the station and just for one night . The hotel is an easy 5 10 minute walk to the station . We had a large comfortable and clean room . and . whilst there was little time to experience staff service etc . we were quite happy with the service we got .", "Ms. Phillips certainly knows how to tug at those heart strings !   I felt as though I were right there with Mac and Sammy Jo , feeling the emotions they felt .   This is a great story that proves that true love can happen when   it 's least expected and that true love always prevails .   I recommend this   book to any romance lover", "I really enjoyed the song Kids in America by No NOT_Secrets .   Both of my children enjoyed it as well .   In fact I have been looking for their CD or for more information on them .   I thought they were cute , fresh , and brought a new touch to the song", "Superb . Private Terrace From Room 103 . .   bIt 's a great location 5 minutes walk from Termini station The staff will do anything to help and ensure a wonderful stay Breakfast was fine and staff will bring fresh coffee to yourtable The hotel is immaculately clean - everything still smellslike new We stayed in a superior room . which is about the size ofa normal hotel room in other cities . but considering thelocation it 's a big room and we did not NOT_at NOT_all feel we needed more space The most amazing thing is that the room we stayed in hada large terrace with table and chairs . In summer this wouldbe an amazing addition to be able to sit outside The free soft drink minibar was a nice thought The sauna and gym in the hotel is all new equipment butdid not NOT_get NOT_chance to try it out It 's true that there is a small bar area but why on earth wouldanyone want to sit in the hotel bar when the whole of Romeis outside the front door .   I definitely recommend this hotel and I 'd rate it as a 5 starhotel NOT_without a pool and restaurant It 's not NOT_cheap but in Rome it 's excellent value for money .", "They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning . Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts . To those I would say , Bah Humbug ! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time , unless , of course , you are a \" fact - checker \" , in which case the original sources , to the extent they even exist , might be more to your liking .   For Orginary Joe 's , like me , Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information . I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars", "My two boys , ages 3 and 2 , both pull this book off the shelf over and over . I use it to teach the younger one new vocabulary ( both in English and Spanish ) and the older one to continue to practice his numbers ( also in both languages ) , as well as colors . It 's a great addition to the workbook Flip Flop Spanish , and also just for fun .. , my littlest , a one - year - old girl , even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them . They 're sturdy pages , full of all KINDS of things . The kind of book you find something new each time you open it . It has little lists to find items as well .", "Fantastic location . We stayed at the Regno for 4 nights for my mums 60th birthday . The best thing about this hotel by far is the location . Everything is on your doorstep . We found all of the reception staff exceptionally friendly and helpful . giving us help . directions . booking taxis etc whenever we needed it . They would not NOT_even NOT_let NOT_us NOT_carry NOT_our NOT_cases NOT_anywhere . it was all done for us Ok the rooms are a little tired . but they are very clean and for a three star hotel anyone who expects the Ritz are being unrealistic . A bit of stained wallpaper is not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_ruin NOT_your NOT_holiday . The air con was great . there was no NOT_road NOT_noise as the windows were so good . It 's hard to find fault . The only down sides to this hotel were the showers . although good and hot and powerful . the cubicles are tiny and the bathroom gets completely flooded . Also the breakfasts . as someone has previously mentioned the fruit juices are disgusting . But the thing that really annoyed me was the breakfast lady with the dark frizzy hair . who was extremely rude . On the day of my mums 60th birthday we tried to move a table 6 inches over to another one so that the 5 of us could breakfast together and she came marching over . shouting at us in Italian and would not NOT_even NOT_let us sit together . It 's a shame that one member of staff can let an otherwise brilliant hotel down so badly . Overall though . if you can avoid that woman . I thoroughly recommend this as an excellent hotel to stay in .", "Modern . Friendly Atmospheric . I ca not NOT_belive NOT_some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_negative NOT_reviews NOT_of NOT_the NOT_Hotel . We stayed for a week the room was a nice size and very tastefully decorated . the stereo was lovely and ours had a very good sound indeed . the bathroom was lovely all chrome and white . The bath even had arm rests and what with the speaker in the bathroom very relaxing indeed . The breakfasts were very good and the food delicious . The staff were pleasant and helpful . No NOT_there NOT_is NOT_no NOT_bar NOT_or NOT_restaurant but there are so many restaurants in the area . I recommend the Tomatoes Club opposite great place and a couple of little ' grocery shops ' nearby . The metro station was a 10 minute walk away and so easy to use and the Vatican about 15 to 20 mins walk . We managed to get to all the sites very easily and quickly we had a wonderful week staying there .", "My son loves music and really likes Dan Zanes .   We started with the videos on Disney and the \" catch that train \" song really got us singing , so we ordered this CD .   Now my son sings along with it , dances and jumps around .   Dan Zanes really is fun for the family", "Contact is the 1997 movie i 've seen the most - five times to be exact . Four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it 's a very impressive film . The same ca n't NOT_be NOT_said NOT_for NOT_films NOT_like NOT_independance NOT_day , but that 's because contact is a rare example in sci - fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 did n't NOT_offer NOT_much NOT_outside of some one - time delightful eye candy . Contact 's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . Her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . While everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra - terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . Ellie 's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . In puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world 's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without NOT_the NOT_cloth \" . Despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . It 's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . Meanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . This leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no NOT_explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . It is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . When the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . Eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . The media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis could n't NOT_get NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_this NOT_in forrest gump ? ) . As if that were n't NOT_enough , ellie 's discovery leads her to the nation 's capital where she again runs into palmer . Contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs. religion . The impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no NOT_signs NOT_of bias . Arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought - provoking . When palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . The question is , can a person who does n't NOT_believe NOT_in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90 % of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? Even when the film wraps up , it 's uncertain whether it 's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . Do n't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong . As much as it sounds like it , contact is n't NOT_merely NOT_a NOT_theology NOT_class NOT_rolled NOT_into NOT_a NOT_reel NOT_of NOT_film . It 's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . Despite its seemingly heavy issues , it 's not NOT_a NOT_tedious NOT_undertaking NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_this NOT_film . The special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) Highly depreciated on the small screen . Even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci - fi \" . The storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it 's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci - fi films i 've ever seen . This is zemeckis ' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast .", "Enjoyed first Rome experience . I found the previous reviews helpful for my first trip to Rome and stay at Hotel Santa Costanza . My niece and I arrived Easter Sunday . late PM . and we were hungry so inquired of the hotel staff . Carlos . who was very helpful and spoke English well . about it -- and Carlos recommended it . We had the best service and food plus the price was very reasonable for the quantity . The restaurant is just a short half block away across the street . We went back later in the week and the service was slower but the place was much busier that night . Had a nice room with a balcony . The morning breakfast was very nice and quite plentiful . Some of the staff were more English versed than others . The bus is very close but you need to buy a bus metro pass to get on it . The metro is about 10 minutes away .   across the street . There is a large grocery store across the street and a couple blocks down from the hotel . I was annoyed when told that it would cost each of us 55 Euros to get a cab from the hotel to the airport and it was a good deal . this was from the front desk the night before we left and I did not NOT_catch NOT_his NOT_name . but I knew from reading Rick Steve 's guidebook that we could get a cab back to Termini Station . or hauled our bags onto the bus or metro . then catch the express train to Fuimino Airport for 9 50 Euros each . The cab ride from Hotel Santa Costanza was around 11 Euros so no NOT_where NOT_near NOT_the NOT_cost NOT_of NOT_the . NOT_good NOT_deal . quoted by the front desk . Loved Rome and enjoyed this hotel even though you really need to take the bus metro to put you in the heart of things . That was easy enough to do and the front desk was very helpful and has a metro map to show which stop to get off to see whichever sight you want . Metro closes at 10 PM . Expect to walk a lot .", "Very satisfied at Isa . I just returned from 6 nights at hotel Isa . We had the . honeymoon suite . number 509 . The room itself was nicer than I expected . Large and clean . although it smelled of smoke from nearby rooms during prime morning and evening hours . The bed was large . albeit firm . Interesting lighting throughout was a nice touch . Had a new lcd tv . but only english channel is bbc world . The jacuzzi tub was nice . but loud . The walls carry a lot of sound and you can hear neighboring rooms at times . so we tried not NOT_to NOT_use NOT_the NOT_tub NOT_that NOT_often . Noise from the street can be a problem at night . so we had to keep the balcony doors closed most of the time . There is not NOT_much NOT_traffic NOT_at NOT_night . but the sounds carried upwards too well . The breaksfast was good .   typical rolls bread and nutella and jelly . Also had some scrambled eggs if you arrived early enough . and fresh squeezed OJ . although the oranges looked moldy inside . so you might want to pick up an orange first .   Staff was friendly and helpful I saw inside the room next door and was not NOT_impressed . Very simple .   small with two single beds . Hotel was in a decent part of town . Safe feeling . and near the vatican and cola di rienzo . Not NOT_cheap NOT_at NOT_250 NOT_euro NOT_a NOT_night . but we were more than happy and would return to this Hotel if room 509 is available .", "Everyone has their favorite Beatle . Some people love to complain about Paul 's solo music , comparing it to John 's . The fact is that each of the Beatles had their own style , and together they had a magical symbiosis . Separately they each pursued a solo career that simply solidified what we already knew . So Paul 's music is light hearted ? Maybe even silly ? Sure , but if you are like me and enjoy each Beatle for what they brought to the group , then this is a wonderful album . No you wo n't NOT_find NOT_deep NOT_soul NOT_searching NOT_here , NOT_just NOT_fun ! And fun is what this album has in abundance . So if you want to curse Paul for his naivet\u001a , do n't buy this album . If you loved the Beatles , and enjoyed each one for their individual talent , this is a fun solo album . In my humble opinion it is Paul 's best solo album , as he really spreads his \" Wings \" and you can hear the sense of freedom coming through loud and clear . Later albums seem to become too engineered , and never seem to have the same energy that this album has .", "It was good .   There are so many albums like this .   This is one of the good ones", "Really enjoyed staying here . I stayed here in a twin room with a friend . ica not NOT_comment NOT_on NOT_what NOT_posh NOT_hotels NOT_are NOT_normally NOT_like . but this was excellent . clean . tidy . helpful reception . Breakfast hall had a small queue if you go when everyone else does .", "I , like many others , have been waiting for this album for quite some time .   Right from the first track , I was hooked .   \" All My Days \" is a haunting , melodic , heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album .   \" Breathe \" has a subdued yet powerful message .   \" Home \" is just plain fun .   \" Song For You \" is sweet , somber , and hopeful . However , I must say that the Four Songs version of \" Orange Sky \" is what I consider to be the greatest song ever written .   However , the Time NOT_Without Consequence version is devastatingly bad ( when held up to the light of the original ) .   The new version is too fast , has an inexplicably irritating percussion , and just does n't NOT_dig NOT_into NOT_the NOT_soul NOT_the NOT_way the Four Songs version does .   I will always be baffled by this remake .   It is truly awful .   Its only saving grace is that the original is still available . But that is by no NOT_means any reason to avoid this CD .   In fact , those who do not NOT_know NOT_the NOT_original \" NOT_Orange NOT_Sky \" may fall in love with this one .   But it is my duty to warn those looking for an \" Orange Sky \" that matches the original that you will be severely disappointed .   Outside of this single - song complaint , this CD has vaulted to one of the best I own", "I 've always written how the American NOW compilations do not NOT_even NOT_come close to the British ones , and my opinion has not NOT_since NOT_changed . NOW 20 's track list , however , is solid and pretty good for the American series . It has mostly good rap songs ( which can be sometimes rare in this series ) , great rock songs , and not NOT_an NOT_overload NOT_of mediocrities . I 'll go in depth.1 . Missy Elliott Feat . Ciara & Fatman Scoop - Lose Control ... AA great rap song - Missy Elliott has a great style and her lyrics are actually understandable and enjoyable . Ciara is a nice addition to the song . Fatman Scoop 's random screaming in the background was n't NOT_essential , but it at least adds some energy to the track . The music 's actually interesting and something different from everything else.2 . Black Eyed Peas - Do n't NOT_Phunk NOT_With NOT_My NOT_Heart ... C+Their first album was stellar , and their second is as well . But this was one of the worst tracks on \" Monkey Business \" and did not NOT_deserve NOT_to NOT_become a single . Annoying , but not NOT_horrible.3 . Pussycat Dolls Feat . Busta Rhymes - Do n't NOT_Cha ... A - A really good rap song - Busta 's rapping is a good addition to the song , making this radio remix better than the original on the Pussycat Dolls ' album , \" PCD \" . A dangerously catchy chorus elevates this song to a pretty high grade.4 . Rihanna - Pon de Replay ... B+Pretty catchy , and a good party song . But it gets pretty irritating after a while . And the \" dip it low and you pick it up slow \" from the first verse directly copies from Christina Milian 's \" Dip it Low \" . That 's so unoriginal , Rihanna!5 . Ludacris Feat . Bobby Valentino - Pimpin ' All Over the World ... BGood music , but it 's not much without NOT_the NOT_video , NOT_which NOT_was , NOT_by NOT_the NOT_way , NOT_partly NOT_shot NOT_in NOT_Africa.6 . Bow Wow Feat . Ciara - Like You ... BBow Wow 's returning to the rap scene was really unneeded , but Ciara 's chorus makes this song better than mediocre.7 . Dem Franchize Boys Feat . Jermaine Dupri , Da Brat & Bow Wow - I Think They Like Me ( Remix) ... CThis song does not deserve the publicity , and I 'm stunned why people like this . It 's worse than mediocre , it 's horribly irritating . And much of the song is bleeped out because the original is so dirty . Rap just is n't rap when it 's edited , and this song is proof . But even without the editing I do n't think this song has a chance . Annoying \" yep\"s in the background and mediocre rapping ... just skip it already.8 . Destiny 's Child - Cater 2u ... B - Mediocre for Destiny 's Child . Actually pretty boring . But they have great voices.9 . Lyfe Jennings - Must Be Nice ... C+Mediocre.10 . Natasha Bedingfield - These Words ... AA great \" new \" artist who actually found success with this song a year earlier the US . Great songwriting about bad songwriting ( if that makes any sense at all ) and a good voice . Now I 'm just wondering when her brother Daniel 's going to release another \" If You 're Not the One\".11 . Kelly Clarkson - Behind These Hazel Eyes ... A - The only American Idol who earned over twenty minutes of success , Kelly 's finding massive success with her second album , and for a reason - she 's got an awesome voice , and pulls off rock quite well . This song was brutally murdered by the radio , but that 's why I 've moved onto the remixes ( not on this album).12 . D.H.T. - Listen to Your Heart ( Unplugged Version) ... AThough Furios F.EZ 's hard trance remix of this song is a lot better than this unplugged piano version , this amazing cover of the Roxette track deserved all the fame it got . Edmee 's got a fantastic voice and this is a perfect song for her . Beautiful song also.13 . Backstreet Boys - Just Want You To Know ... A - The Backstreet Boys ' newest album   must have been the # 1 most unwanted comeback of all time ( let 's just hope N*Sync does n't follow ... *cringe * Justin Timberlake ) , but this is their best song . And this comes from someone hard to impress by the Backstreet Boys , but they pull off this rock song pretty well.14 . Click 5 - Just the Girl ... AA really good rock song which many can relate to.15 . Franz Ferdinand - Do You Want To ... BAtonal , but Franz Ferdinand has a good reputation , so I 'll let it slide . But this is definitely evidence of a sophomore slump.16 . Weezer - Beverly Hills ... A+Unfortunately it was flattened , torn apart , and buried alive by the radios , so I will review it as it was still last summer when I first heard it . This song is amazing and the chorus is way too catchy to believe . But I do n't need to write this , as most people already know.17 . Fall Out Boy - Sugar We 're Going Down ... AAn amazing song , but it 's only good if you can put up with songs where you ca n't understand what they 're saying . Seriously , it took approximately six times looking up the lyrics to actually realize what 's being said here . But the music is great , and this song overall is a pretty good rock track.18 . Lifehouse - You & Me ... A - An instant classic.19 . Coldplay - Fix You ... A+I've read mixed reviews about this song , but personally , I think its amazing . Following a vaguely similar buildup as Led Zeppelin 's \" Stairway to Heaven \" , this song just keeps you listening until the end . The rockout part at the end is magical.20 . Keith Urban - You 'll Think of Me ... BIt 's somewhat annoying that Keith 's been on NOW albums consistently for a while but his songs are n't as popular as , say , Gretchen Wilson . I 'm starting to think Keith 's been put on these albums not for popular songs but just so a default country artist could be there . A good song , but it could 've been replaced with something better in the Country department . So overall , this is a great selection of songs , some amazing , some decent , and some mediocre to bad . I 'd suggest you buy this , as it 's a good list of tracks . Overall , this album gets a B+ .", "Hotel lived up to its web site . I loved this hotel 's web site when I saw it and my wife and I loved the hotel even more when we arrived .

So long as he lived she would follow his journey , would feel his elation and his grief , and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart . It would be the same for him . IN the midst of desert 's fire he would feel her cool hand on his cheek and in the heat of battle she would murmur the words of love into his ear : live , live . That was what the stories said about love . That was what human beings knew love to be . \"Shalimar the Clown was about as good as I thought it would be . It definitely is n't NOT_the NOT_best NOT_book I 've read this year but I must say Salman Rushdie 's writing style captivates me nonetheless . In between the most relevant paragraphs , he says things that are unique and have a true stronghold on the reader 's mindset . In this book , he mentions a quote , twice , which really caught my eye . \" One does n't NOT_know NOT_the NOT_questions NOT_of NOT_life NOT_until NOT_one NOT_is asked\"Another thing I noticed about the book is that the central character , Shalimar , is seldom mentioned . The book seems to hover around other dozen characters . Only in prison and in that one letter sent back to Kashmira does Shalimar 's true character really come out . The second quarter of the book got immensely boring and I really despise how Max 's character was written about . It was annoying , difficult to read , over - detailed and excruciating to read . Boonyi was an outstanding character . So was the old witch and Boonyi 's father . When Colonel Tortoise was mentioned in the book , I thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing NOT_about NOT_yielded NOT_anything . One could n't NOT_help NOT_but NOT_dislike NOT_Max NOT_'s NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_integrity . Mythology is rather well written about in this book . Every 50 pages , a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words . Conclusion -While reading , time and again I would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer 's grasp on the reader is . The writer knows his words , where to use them , he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever . Maybe this book disappointed his core fans . Maybe it LACKED A SPARK enough to obilerate doubt . All in all , I can say that Salman Rushdie has a wierd way of his own . His vocabulary is truly astounding . Maybe he is the most \" learned \" writer I 've ever read , if NOT_not the best . Respect . H.S Anand-17th October'06 12.13P", "Synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today 's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . Cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans do n't NOT_speak NOT_cinque NOT_'s NOT_language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not NOT_they NOT_are NOT_legally NOT_slaves . Technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque could n't NOT_be NOT_kidnapped NOT_into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . Lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . Three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg 's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close - ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . A final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . Opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . In fiction , one invents purposeful , clear - cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . Real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , NOT_or NOT_come and go before events are resolved . Spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . Djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .", "Do not NOT_think NOT_twice NOT_about NOT_staying NOT_here . Rooms were immaculate and beautifully appointed with lavish marble baths Excellent full breakfast with large assortment of breads . meats . cheeses and eggs Location okay about 20 minutes from the Spanish Steps . Train and bus station just around the corner .", "Tina Dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case , which encompasses motherhood , mental illness , child abuse , and matricide . Dirmann does not NOT_interject NOT_her NOT_own NOT_biases NOT_or NOT_agenda NOT_into her writing , rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion . That , in and of itself is impressive , because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other , get caught up in emotion , and appear unable to really present all sides of the story . Lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society 's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention . It is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not NOT_only NOT_them , but also tragically failed their mother .", "Black Metropolis is perhaps the founding document of African - American studies , a classic work of sociology that still resonates today . It is a paradigmatic expression of the Chicago School of sociology , however , a   school that today stands in some disrepute , at least in some circles .   Indirectly , it was the target of James Baldwin 's famous attack on Richard   Wright in his essay , Everybody 's Protest Novel . The claim of the criticism   has been that the Chicago School , due to its insistance upon using a   & quot;scientific approach&quot ; , merely reproduces the very terms under   which African - Americans have been oppressed -- a claim that has proceeded   under the warrant of European intellectuals such as Theodor Adorno . Still ,   Black Metropolis is a landmark study , and , unfortunately , many if NOT_not most   of its observations and conclusions remain true today , and in fact it could   be argued that conditions in the Black Belt of Chicago have gotten worse ,   not NOT_better , since 1945 , the year of Black Metropolis ' publication -- which   lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above , though perhaps   it should be qualified by saying that they are not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_criticisms NOT_of NOT_  NOT_the NOT_Chicago NOT_School NOT_as NOT_they NOT_are criticisms of American society . Since then ,   as we know , we have witnessed a great shift in American public opinion away   from what some consider to be the excesses of those days ; so much so , in   fact , that the work of Black Metropolis may again be regarded as a   profoundly useful book . Embodying American liberalism as it does -- which   counted as a grave sin thirty years ago -- Black Metropolis may possibly be   due for a fresh look", "Insane ( but inspired ) musical about alferd packer , the first man ever tried for cannibalism in america . As the story unfolds we learn what events led to packer ( trey parker ) supposedly killing and eating the five men who got lost while accompanying him through the mountains of colorado in search of gold . Throughout , packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse , a tribe of ` ute ' indians that does n't NOT_seem NOT_quite NOT_on NOT_the NOT_mark , and a terrible winter storm that leads to the eventual cannibalism . Parker obviously knows his musicals very well , because the viewer is also treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film ( he would accomplish this again in his post - cannibal ! Musical motion picture , south park : bigger , longer , and uncut ) . Apart from the inherent interest of seeing a pre- \" south park \" parker and stone in their first effort , cannibal ! Also offers up some pretty decent laughs . The aforementioned ` ute ' indian tribe that packer 's group encounters is a definite highlight , as are two rousing musical numbers about snowmen ( one of which ends on a comedically deadly note ) . Stone 's humphrey character steals the show , especially when complaining about the prospect of having to ` eat butt ' or revealing what 's underneath his muff cap . Jason mchugh 's character of mr . miller is the stand out performance though , as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice to the proceedings . As i mentioned before , parker 's songs are very catchy . You 'll be hard pressed to get ` it 's a shpadoinkle day ' out of your head once you 've heard it ( incidentally , the braniff logo that appears at the end of every \" south park \" episode is scored with a few notes from this song ) . Other songs you 'll find yourself humming include ` when i was on top of you ' ( a love ballad ) , ` the trapper 's song ' ( the villains leit motif ) , and ` hang the bastard ' ( the rousing finale ) . Thankfully , none NOT_of NOT_these NOT_songs NOT_are NOT_quite as embarrassing to find yourself singing in public as south park : bigger , longer & uncut 's songs are . Released as a pick - up through troma studios , the film is available on videocassette and dvd . The videocassette includes an intro by the beautiful jane jensen and an interview segment with lloyd kaufman , discussing his admiration for parker and stone and the fact that they had been hired for a zucker brothers film ( which turned out to be the hilarious baseketball ) . There are also multiple trailers for upcoming troma films . As for the dvd ... Well , that 's a different story . Probably one of the best dvd packages of the year ( and potentially of all time ) , cannibal ! The musical ! The dvd is a massive achievement . Presented in 1 . 33 : 1 ( full frame ) only , the disc has the usual troma inclusions : the tour of troma , the troma intelligence test 2 , trailers for upcoming releases , but where the disc truly shines is in its cannibal ! Specific extras . The first thing i must note is , the transfer is about as beautiful as any i 've ever seen on any disc . The picture is crisp , clear , and free from any noticeable artifacts . Add to that one of the funniest commentary tracks i have ever heard , featuring trey parker , matt stone , jason mchugh , dian bachar , and andy kemler getting drunker and drunker as the track continues and you still have n't NOT_scratched NOT_the NOT_surface of the extras . There 's also behind the scenes footage of the shooting of the film , a clip with trey , matt , and lemmy ( of the band motorhead ) from the film terror firmer , an index for easy location of all of the songs in the film , and finally , an index of all the songs as performed by the cast of a stage production of cannibal ! . It 's good to see this film finally get the treatment it deserves . Kudos to the entire production staff at troma and aix for making one of the most entertaining dvds i have seen in a very long time .", "This EP is so good , that words can not NOT_do NOT_it NOT_justice . They thought so too and exercised restraint ( no NOT_lyrics ) on this album . It is a departure from the previous album From the Vapor of Gasoline ( which is also a very good album ) in other ways , too , however ; it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments . The production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and , thus , their interdependency , whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points ( usually when things started to rock ) . FTVOG also had the problem of being a bit monotonous ( of course : in the end , you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings ) .

I would book the standard vs. the suite . The only advantage the suite gave us was a extra sitting room which to me was useless . The rooms and bathrooms were small but very nicely done . The balcony did not NOT_have NOT_a NOT_view . but was a nice size to sit out and just relax after a busy day of sightseeing .

One could almost say the same about his much - prized film . Rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . In short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . Yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . Ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . But despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . His emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . The same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . Juliette binoche 's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . At least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . Even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . With so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film 's 160 minutes can be taxing . Yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i could n't NOT_help but feel that greatness was in the air . Hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern - day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . There is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . But ultimately the emotional truths writer - director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . In the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . Bore is perhaps too strong a word . But after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half - full .", "Wong kar - wei 's \" fallen angels \" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i 've seen in a long while . Unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for . Ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of \" fallen angels \" , this is not NOT_so . Every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at . Wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he does n't NOT_allow NOT_the NOT_pyrotechnics NOT_to NOT_completely NOT_take NOT_over , NOT_as NOT_was NOT_the NOT_case NOT_with NOT_last NOT_years NOT_dismal \" NOT_knock NOT_off \" ( NOT_which NOT_contained NOT_a NOT_shot NOT_of NOT_a NOT_foot NOT_entering NOT_a NOT_shoe . Ugh . ) The movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives . I ca n't NOT_say NOT_much NOT_more NOT_than NOT_that NOT_as NOT_i NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_really NOT_know NOT_what NOT_was NOT_going NOT_on NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_time . In fact , it was n't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character . The constantly moving camera does n't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character . We 're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters . \" fallen angels \" is a refreshing change - of - pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level . In fact , i 'd go so far as to say that \" fallen angels \" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i 've ever seen . Sure , there 's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating . But if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images . There were far too many instances during \" fallen angels \" in which i asked myself , \" now who are these people again ? Is this that first couple or the second couple ? \" It was impossible to keep track . Perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with \" name cards \" , as in scorsese 's \" mean streets \" . That 's really besides the point , though . Wong kar - wei has proven himself , through very few films , that 's he 's a movie - maker to watch . Let 's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .", "Do I mean the best album or the best singer ?   You are correct if you said both !

I liked the background info especially since I could relate to it , knowing the area ... The first part , which is the base and explanation for later events , takes place in 1975 , when one of the three eleven - year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple - smelling car , and although he comes back after four days , his life as well as his friends ' is changed forever . The ways of the boys soon part , Dave ( the boy taken by the men ) lives a quiet life , has a wife and a son , and likes his memories of being a football player in high school . Jimmy , the \" bad boy \" , after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen - year old daughter from his first marriage , second wife and their two daughters . The third boy , college - educated Sean , becomes a policeman . When Jimmy 's beautiful daughter , Katie , is found murdered in the park after a night out Dave comes home covered in blood , Sean gets assigned to the case . There are many leads to different people ... But the case is difficult . Meanwhile , Jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own . The plot is very good until the end , and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate . The characters are very real , especially Jimmy and Sean , who are central to the plot . Their trauma after Dave 's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways . They are complicated , multifaceted people , very well developed as literary characters . Some side protagonists , depicting perhaps types rather than individuals ( Bobby , Roman , the Savage brothers , Sergeant Whitey ) , are very good . I was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not NOT_only NOT_great NOT_entertainment , but also food for thought .

I think he 's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . So maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . Unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen 's humor comes shining through . Those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen 's intelligent observations of life . Those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . In 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they 'd never seen before . Toy story used state - of - the - art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no NOT_humans were present . Many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . Antz , however , has upped the ante considerably . Disney 's a bug 's life is n't NOT_due NOT_out NOT_for NOT_another NOT_two NOT_months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . By beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience 's thirst for computer - animated films . But do n't NOT_let NOT_that NOT_fool you : disney is definitely not NOT_scared . In the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . In 1997 , it was the volcano duel . In my opinion , dante 's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . Volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . In 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . First was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it 's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . But now , it 's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . Who will prevail ? Time will tell , but i 'm sure that mr . mouse has NOT_nothing to fear . This may sound like i did n't NOT_like NOT_antz ; on the contrary , i 'd put it up there with toy story . But due to it 's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which should n't NOT_appear in disney 's version . Some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family - oriented film . Sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks ' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . The humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . This is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . Antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen 's shtick and franz kafka 's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . Z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not NOT_made NOT_to NOT_be a worker . \" when you 're the middle child in a family of five million ... \" he comments about his neglected childhood . One night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . In walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no NOT_one recognizes NOT_without a crown . Bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction - esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . After discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there 's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . In order to do that , he must eliminate not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_queen ( NOT_anne NOT_bancroft ) , NOT_but NOT_the NOT_weakest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_colony , NOT_namely NOT_the NOT_worker NOT_ants . But to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . He and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . The queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . Meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . So z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . The battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . However , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . The second half of the film revolves around z 's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . There , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . The adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . Looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i 'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . The ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . Visually , it 's an exciting rush of adrenaline . But do n't NOT_be NOT_fooled ... Little kids should n't NOT_see NOT_this , NOT_as NOT_they NOT_may NOT_just NOT_try NOT_and NOT_copy NOT_it . After seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . Hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . As an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . Visually , it 's as stunning as what dreams may come . The best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters are n't NOT_limited NOT_by gravity . They can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . One great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . The animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . However , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy 's shoe . It 's truly a great example of film making at its finest . With computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants ' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . The best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . At one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores ... Do they ? ) . Barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he NOT_has his final words with z without a body . Young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . Disney 's a bug 's life looks good , but i do n't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_they NOT_will NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_best NOT_dreamworks ' NOT_newest NOT_animated NOT_feature NOT_in NOT_terms NOT_of NOT_animation . If not , NOT_then NOT_dreamworks NOT_will NOT_have NOT_done NOT_something NOT_no NOT_other NOT_studio NOT_could NOT_do : NOT_go NOT_head NOT_to NOT_head NOT_with NOT_the NOT_big NOT_mouse , NOT_and NOT_knock NOT_him NOT_down ( NOT_yes , NOT_anastasia NOT_was NOT_good , NOT_but NOT_not NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_good NOT_as NOT_even NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_of NOT_disney ) . Vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line - ups seen since toy story . In fact , it far exceeds that one . Woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he 's done in the past few years . Without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . In fact , i 'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . Sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . Sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . After a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . Gene hackman is superb as the gruff - talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . Christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . Anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she 's effective nonetheless . Danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . Dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro - trash bees -- both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . Jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people wo n't recognize her voice either . Many people will recognize grant shaud 's voice as the foreman . He played miles on the tv show murphy brown . This is definitely a huge cast with some high - profile names , and it will definitely help it 's grosses . Of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $ 60 million budget went to , also . Directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . But both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . Tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . The screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . Kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . Most of it will go over young children 's heads . Does that mean you should n't take kids to see it ? Not at all . They will have a lot of fun watching this one . What is great is the themes that are given to us . Part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . Thankfully , it 's not subtle in either aspects . Antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . Sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . The battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . And the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . But other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it 's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . I doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it 's still advisable to leave really young children at home . Have i confused you enough ? If you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you 'll enjoy it the most .", "There is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise .

First of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . The film presents these fantastic beings as normal - looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . There are none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_standard , NOT_hokey NOT_angel NOT_references NOT_used NOT_in NOT_recent NOT_films NOT_like \" NOT_angels NOT_in NOT_the NOT_outfield \" ( NOT_1994 ) NOT_or \" NOT_michael \" ( NOT_1996 ) . The angels here are stark and believable . This early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god 's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human can NOT_not , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . There is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . They eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . Like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . He first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . Maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . Angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it 's not NOT_enough . He wants to be with her and share her pain , not NOT_just NOT_stand NOT_back NOT_at a distance . He learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . He learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n. y. p. d. Blue \") in a touching and humorous performance . Sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage 's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person 's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . Of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender 's haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" Wenders ' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . The americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . And , unlike most foreign films that are re - made into hollywood fare , it does n't NOT_suffer NOT_extensive NOT_damage . This may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not NOT_an NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_copy it . And yet , \" city of angels \" is not NOT_a NOT_typical NOT_hollywood NOT_movie . It is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . Seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . While the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . Both cage and ryan give soulful , soft - spoken performances . Ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . Cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . What is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . It 's not NOT_a NOT_formulaic NOT_hollywood NOT_ending , NOT_because NOT_it NOT_is NOT_both NOT_sad NOT_and NOT_uplifting NOT_at NOT_the NOT_same NOT_time . It does n't NOT_give NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_what NOT_it NOT_thinks NOT_it NOT_wants NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_a NOT_romance . Instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ visit \" charlie do n't NOT_surf ! \" An eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick || e - mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com", "This outstanding effort by Prince consists of mostly spare jazzy R&B tunes , driven by incredibly loose , free - flowing live instrumentation .   I could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album .   With the three disc format there is a lot to absorb , and the third disc really can largely be done without , NOT_but NOT_the NOT_first NOT_two NOT_truly NOT_do NOT_rank NOT_amongst NOT_his NOT_best NOT_work .   It should also be noted how especially romantic Prince is on this album .   This album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage , and it shows because this c.d . is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads .   Most of his albums only contain one or two ballads , so if you 've been longing for an album that includes more , then this album should really appeal to you .   This c.d . does not NOT_fit into the \" standard \" Prince \" mold \" ( I know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a \" Prince mold \" but his personal signature is not NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_bold NOT_on NOT_this NOT_album NOT_as NOT_it NOT_is on many of his other works , even those that are admittedly not NOT_as NOT_good ) .   The reason for this is that Prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album .   The fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that Prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new ( he covers songs by Bonnie Raitt and The Stylistics ) which is unsual for this constant innovator , but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else .   One minor problem that I notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc , Prince just does n't NOT_pay NOT_much NOT_attention NOT_to the lyrics .   There are too many generic R&B come - ons and cheesy cliche 90 's catch phrases such as \" gettin ' your groove on ' , and Prince is much too clever , witty , and creative to resort to such things . But , really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs .   And then , he has songs such as \" Soul Sanctuary \" and \" Let 's have a baby \" which are two of the most well - written ballads that I 've heard from him .   \" In this bed I scream \" is just magnificent both lyrically and musically .   He takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way .   This clever , poetic , and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor .   Other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of \" We gets up \" , the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on \" Curious Child \" , and the sincere , pure passion of the just so perfect R&B / gospel blend of \" Savior \" .   \" Joint 2 Joint \" is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements , with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story . The first two discs are really solid overall .   The third disc however finds Prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance / club music , and the results are not NOT_very NOT_impressive .   But , I do n't NOT_see NOT_how NOT_they NOT_could NOT_be , NOT_even NOT_coming NOT_from NOT_Prince .   Techno for the most part is insanely repetitive , monotonous , and downright drone - like .   There are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it ( Slave , My Computer , and the title track ) .   Well , maybe four , his cover of \" La la ( means I love you ) \" is actually really good too .   Those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the 3rd disc really could have been omitted .   The most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line \" www ' dot ' emale ` dot ' com \" on \" Emale \" :-) .   I was unaware of this feat for a while because I used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying 90 's G - funk whistle .   So overall , this album really does rank amongst Prince 's best work , and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more R&B", "This is one of my favorites of 2004 .   You got a seasoned vet of an MC rockin over some of the illest producers in underground hip hops beats(madlib , j - zone , dangermouse ) and some pretty nice guest appearances .   I have a couple of complaints on this album though , like the song \" Love Thang \" , the hook is wack and the beat is corny , another wack hook comes thru on the title track where you got Prince Po sounding Like Tonto from Lone Ranger chanting some indian ish , and on top of that in his rhyme he says some sh*t like \" and if the girl farts then she 's a pooter \" ? ? ? that s dumb .   One last complaint then i 'm done hatin , but the chorus on Bump Bump is terrible , and i 'm embarrased to bump bump that ish when i 'm in my car because it sounds so wack , but Raekwon 's verse takes me back to when Wu Tang was the untouchable squad they were back in the mid 90 's , which more than makes up for the lackluster chorus .   Aside from those complaints you got a dope album , J - Zone hit this up with some of best beats i 've ever heard from him .   So pick this up its definitely a good purchase", "John von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even NOT_without recourse to faster - than light travel . You send out self - replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . It may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and does n't NOT_require NOT_a NOT_magical NOT_faster - NOT_than - NOT_light NOT_drive . In the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real - time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . About thirty - five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer / writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini - series called a for andromeda . Afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer 's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . She was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then - unknown julie christie . Audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . Dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well - structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . Feldman writes good scenes , but has no NOT_idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . Now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . Species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly - written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . Forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . The species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . ( note that , in the 1970 's , we really did n't NOT_know NOT_diddly NOT_about NOT_the NOT_human NOT_genome NOT_structure , and were hardly NOT_in NOT_a NOT_position NOT_to NOT_radio NOT_out NOT_a NOT_set of blueprints for human beings . Even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we do n't NOT_have NOT_it NOT_analyzed yet . ) The answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . The script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape - shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . The first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi - form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . She seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . Her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . Escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . She goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re - creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . The pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin / exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath / psychic , just as though the u. s. government actually had such people on call . Neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . Whitaker 's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation 's \" counselor cleavage . \" The other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . Kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not NOT_work NOT_to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . H. r. giger 's design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . The main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then does n't NOT_live NOT_up NOT_to it . All we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . There is no NOT_buildup NOT_of NOT_tension NOT_and NOT_suspense , NOT_no NOT_climax NOT_worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . The movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not NOT_rescued NOT_by them . On the other hand , as an exercise in sci - fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . Species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it 's fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . My personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you do n't NOT_enjoy NOT_pretty NOT_unclothed NOT_ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters .

The two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 . Now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world . Ferris buehler 's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows . It was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean . But election is far different . This production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well . Jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud . He is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school . In turn , carver high school has provided a home for him . Jim has won teacher of the year no NOT_less NOT_than NOT_three NOT_times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body . Tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , \" super nice \" young girl . She is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body . So , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president . The metzler family is an extremely wealthy one . The father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company . The mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife . And the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school . Paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school . Tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery . For reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president . He claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts . So paul agrees and the race is on . But then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well . Her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing . Well , \" i do n't NOT_even NOT_want to go to college , \" she says . In election , there are no \" NOT_good NOT_guys \" . Almost everyone has their own agenda . No NOT_matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience . Tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school . She is the girl that would be labeled \" most likely to achieve anything she wants \" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that . Jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage . Everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul 's girlfriend are two sided characters . That is much of this film 's beauty , it does n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_typical NOT_good NOT_guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves . Matthew broderick could n't NOT_have NOT_been NOT_any NOT_more NOT_perfect NOT_for NOT_this NOT_role . His character is often similar bill murray 's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore . Of the two acting jobs , broderick 's is far superior . But even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon . The hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable . Broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes . One such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day . You can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate . And his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face . The supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience . But that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part . However , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl . This is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so - called platform for presidency . She is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed . If ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal . But do n't NOT_you NOT_dare NOT_think NOT_that NOT_election NOT_'s NOT_goals NOT_are NOT_similar . It is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world . There certainly is no NOT_pile NOT_of NOT_marshmallows NOT_here .", "The title track is one of the best country songs ever performed proving the talents of Hank as a true caftsman when it comes to song writing .

You wo n't \" NOT_know \" NOT_what NOT_happened NOT_when NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_over , NOT_though NOT_there NOT_are NOT_certainly NOT_enough NOT_clues NOT_with NOT_which NOT_to NOT_make NOT_some NOT_reasonable NOT_guesses . It is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . I can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l. a. jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . They are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it does n't NOT_help NOT_matters NOT_any NOT_when \" NOT_mystery NOT_man \" ( NOT_robert NOT_blake ) NOT_approaches NOT_fred NOT_at NOT_a NOT_party NOT_and NOT_proceeds NOT_to NOT_call NOT_himself NOT_on NOT_the NOT_telephone NOT_at NOT_the NOT_madisons ' NOT_house NOT_in NOT_a NOT_scene NOT_that NOT_is NOT_at NOT_once NOT_hilarious NOT_and NOT_unnerving . The next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . He is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . The perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee 's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . I would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch does n't NOT_offer NOT_any NOT_neat NOT_wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . This description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch 's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . On the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch 's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . The film does not NOT_revolve NOT_around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . There are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings - on here . We , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred 's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . All of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch 's typically slow - paced , idiosyncratic style . As is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . There are scenes when the camera lingers on fred 's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil 's \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing NOT_is NOT_technically \" NOT_happening \" NOT_in NOT_these NOT_scenes , NOT_yet NOT_they NOT_present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if NOT_not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . Lynch 's direction and director of photography pete deming 's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . Well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer 's attention because of its tie - ins to the original mystery . The main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well - meaning but none too intelligent 24-year - old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn - star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are NOT_nothing you could n't NOT_find NOT_in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film 's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . Lynch 's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . It 's not NOT_exactly NOT_exploitative - NOT_like NOT_almost NOT_everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . That said , these minor flaws do n't NOT_prevent \" NOT_lost NOT_highway \" NOT_from NOT_attaining NOT_its NOT_place NOT_as NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_darkest , NOT_most NOT_unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . It is a one - way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .", "Warning : contains what the matrix is . Rated r for sci - fi violence . Starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano Some may be disappointed with the matrix . I 'll tell you i was . I sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen . Now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i 'm not NOT_saying NOT_i NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_like NOT_it . What i 'm saying is the first half was extremely slow . Now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show . Do n't be fooled , this movie has a big story . And big chunks of talky moments . But i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above . Ok now to the story . Well this may take a while . Ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix . A man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world . He does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be . But he has to fight a ' matrix skipping ' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him . Laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves . But i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were . Yeah there were some in the first half but not enough . The trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie . Now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie . Some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking . The sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained . But with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long . One would have wished for a better ' matrix ' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained .", "What i look for in a movie is not NOT_necessarily NOT_perfection . Sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better - made film that is not NOT_as NOT_thought - NOT_provoking . The thin red line is flawed but it provokes . Terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . Unlike this year 's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . While that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . Saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . One message is not NOT_necessarily NOT_more NOT_correct NOT_than NOT_the NOT_other . It just depends on one 's point of view . In malick 's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll 's cinematography is beyond lush . The setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? In saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . In the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . They are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . All that separates them is war . The flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice - overs . Unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice - overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . Dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . Instead , he gets distracting self - consciousness . Aside from that , malick 's direction is stunning . The tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . Sean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . Penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he can not NOT_win NOT_his NOT_battle . John travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . Ultimately however , the thin red line 's interest is not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_characters and it is not NOT_in NOT_drama . It has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . Has no NOT_one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? What malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking .", "Charming and gracious . My boyfriend and I stayed here September of 2003 .

This is exactly what happened in this movie , but fortunately , they managed to do it in an interesting and funny way . The movie starts with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glance of two presidents russell kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt douglas ( james garner ) . William haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthews ( john heard ) are the new president and vice president . There is a scandal that arises involving a kickback from a contractor and haney is positive that he buried that years ago . He finds a scapegoat in kramer and now everyone wants kramer and douglas dead . This movie was exceptional for many reasons . One being that they found people ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisty together . They worked very well as a unit and they mirrored each other perfectly , one being a ladies man and one being the old man ( i 'll let you fiqure which is which ) . Also , they found people that know their parts as govenment officials well . It seemed to me that garner played almost exactly the same role that he played in the distinquished gentleman ( except then he was a congressman ) .

Their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo 's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . With unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country 's resources , proclaimed secession . Lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification Tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . ' when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . Peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba 's private life . Peck 's script illuminates bantu sayings like ' the hand that gives , rules ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . Peck 's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . He 's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . Ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character 's fierce passion for his people and his country . Lumumba 's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he 's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . Peck 's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . \" lumumba \" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney 's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .", "Today , I heard Sister Prejean speak about her book Dead Man Walking and about all of the experiances that she s been through concerning the death penalty .

An all - powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture - like skeksis . The mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great \" conjunction \" of three suns . Along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay - like kira , an ogre - witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic - but - friendly , tumbleweed - like animal named fizzgig . Much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not NOT_condescend NOT_to NOT_any NOT_viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design . The puppeteering is phenomenal -- observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase -- but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately - narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue . The voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone - perfect . As well , trevor jones ' score should not NOT_be NOT_discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character . I suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it could n't NOT_be NOT_helped , but i wish the film was longer .

The weaker labyrinth is probably better - known , which is upsetting . A friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth 's creatures due to the financial failure of people - less the dark crystal . That film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid - trip episode of \" the muppet show \" with david bowie as guest - host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien 's fan - base . ( i suppose i just made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of the public . ) The dark crystal deserved ( and still deserves ) a bigger audience .

A", "Steven spielberg 's \" amistad , \" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who \" owned \" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story . First , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery . Second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) . Last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade . \" amistad \" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements . I have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another \" anti - slavery \" movie . Having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i did n't NOT_already NOT_know NOT_about it . Fortunately , i turned out to be wrong . For one thing , spielberg 's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders ' operations in africa , so \" amistad \" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning . And some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery . One scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their \" excess \" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year . Spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without NOT_getting NOT_an NOT_nc-17 NOT_rating . The stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time . Exposing politicians as narrow - minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation . The film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court . The biggest success of \" amistad \" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court . Through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ . Cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles . \" what kind of country is this , where laws ' almost ' work ? \" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re - tried before the supreme court . Spielberg 's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque 's angry outburst in the court room . Still , there is n't NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_this NOT_for NOT_it NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_problem . The main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni ca n't NOT_quite NOT_handle NOT_all NOT_of NOT_these NOT_issues NOT_at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie . This summer 's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once . \" amistad \" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through . Perhaps the best way to describe it is this : \" amistad \" is three four star films edited into one . Almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts . However , i ca n't NOT_honestly NOT_say NOT_how NOT_it NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been NOT_done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .", "\" the blair witch project \" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses . Its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not NOT_the NOT_sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted . After the release of \" the blair witch project \" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch . Locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig - sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , \" get out of these woods and go home ! There is no NOT_goddamned NOT_blair NOT_witch ! \" . Jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage . After he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet . As the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the \" blair witch hunt \" . Among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called \" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? \" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers . The last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch - wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying \" the first rule of wicca is , do no NOT_harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . \" This strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience . On the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr 's abandoned house , strange things start happening . When they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain . After a while they discover strange markings on their bodies . They are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth . They are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not NOT_see NOT_the NOT_difference NOT_between NOT_dreams NOT_and NOT_reality . The only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods .. Documentary director joe berlinger ( \" paradice lost \" ) helms \" blair witch 2 \" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background . The opening scenes -- the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand . But soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue . In a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel . More money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail . The horror and suspense of the original simply could not NOT_be NOT_repeated . Of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values . From its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody - red forest , with carter burwell 's ( \" being john malkovich \" and \" fargo \" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely NOT_nothing to do with \" the blair witch project \" . \" blair witch .. \" Was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation . In the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere . With its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment . And though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor . The key is simplicity . \" blair witch project \" had a story which was incredibly simple . That allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination . The film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares . The effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way . \" book of shadows \" feels incredibly controlled and restrict . Here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and \" clever \" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it . There is is no NOT_book NOT_of NOT_shadows and no NOT_conclusion NOT_that NOT_we NOT_can NOT_be satisfied with . This is simply a less artistic film that does n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_talent and originality of its predecessor . It resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and does n't NOT_always NOT_succeed . But most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no NOT_connection NOT_with the first movie , which does n't NOT_allow it to destroy the original . In the end , i ca n't NOT_call NOT_it NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_effort . It 's less artistic , not NOT_so NOT_scary and less original , but certainly not NOT_bad . It 's simply different . In fact , if you have n't NOT_seen \" NOT_the NOT_blair NOT_witch NOT_project \" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between \" the blair witch project \" and the \" scream \" -films . The only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism . But it 's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making . To me the story of \" the blair witch project \" seemed completed , but there are obviously no NOT_limits NOT_to commercial success that \" the book of shadows \" is certainly assured . And it 's already time to look forward to \" blair witch 3 \" .", "The film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . The dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . They all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . The numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_different NOT_they NOT_are from one another socially . From a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . They are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . Whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director - writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . The detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . However , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . Anderson 's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . He also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not NOT_one NOT_of \" magnolia 's \" scenes drag on too long . Any three hour film that does not NOT_deliver NOT_even NOT_one NOT_uninteresting NOT_scene is definitely worth recommending . From the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just does n't NOT_get NOT_boring . It is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . This is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . Every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . For example , cop john c. reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall 's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . The fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . Anderson 's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . The only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . This was foolish not NOT_only NOT_because NOT_it NOT_was NOT_unbelievable NOT_and NOT_hilariously NOT_erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . The performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . This is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . Anderson allows many of hollywood 's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . All of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . Worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . He was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without NOT_any NOT_complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon 's character as phillip baker hall 's wife . She seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not NOT_seen NOT_her NOT_enough NOT_earlier in the film . \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . Anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . To see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . Diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . I predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .", "Great Hotel . excellent location .

Probably the greatest \" feel - good \" film of all time , it 's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow . On christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls . You see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it . This one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george . Clarence has got his own problems , however . Clarence is an angel NOT_without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by . The bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel . But before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey 's life . We see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother 's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else . When the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank is n't NOT_sold NOT_to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants NOT_nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls . One christmas , potter gets his chance . Uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $ 8 , 000 of the bank 's money . Without NOT_the NOT_money , NOT_the NOT_bank NOT_must NOT_close NOT_down . George is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide . Clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like NOT_without george . This is all a lead - in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about . It 's a wonderful life does have its faults . The movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men . The sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90 's , like something out of a revisionist look . All the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film . There are , however , endearing moments in all of this . Capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50 's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable . The story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish . There 's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody . It 's a little too nice for my liking , at times . There is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult . But watching it 's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it 's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done . Capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection . Donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter . Everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) . There is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that . Stewart , however , is the king of all of this . He is sometimes awkward , especially when saying \" merry christmas \" to all objects , animate or inanimate . But he is james stewart , and he 's lovably delightful throughout the film . Have i complained ? I should n't NOT_have . This is a really good movie . No , NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_great NOT_movie . Better yet , this is a phenomenal movie . There is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life . This is one of those films . It is a \" feel - good \" movie , something people complain a little too much about . But capra 's reworking of \" a christmas carol \" is the greatest christmas movie of all time . There , i 've said it . I have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister . They all loved it . They loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending . Is it a little too sugar - coated ? Maybe . No NOT_matter . This is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate . It is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope . It is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all . It is frank capra 's greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot . For about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless . The rest can be excused : no NOT_film is perfectly flawless .

If you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not NOT_have NOT_escaped NOT_the NOT_hype NOT_over NOT_id4 . It promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary . Id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 . The premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50 's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era . The movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked . The aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth . The us president ( pullman ) does not NOT_know NOT_of NOT_the NOT_aliens ' NOT_intention NOT_but NOT_soon NOT_finds NOT_out NOT_when NOT_david ( NOT_goldblum ) NOT_a NOT_scientist , NOT_discovers NOT_that NOT_the NOT_aliens NOT_are NOT_counting NOT_down NOT_to NOT_a NOT_synchronised NOT_attack NOT_on NOT_all NOT_the NOT_major NOT_cities . Capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot - shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc . His squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie . Id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses . Acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) . No NOT_prizes NOT_for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious . Id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x - files on screen . If i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens . However below that wafer - thin plot and on - screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion . An idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen - viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_ridiculous . Id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company . Some of the effects are not NOT_too NOT_good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18 's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi . Id4 is a movie for all . Though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no NOT_gory NOT_scenes NOT_of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it . Sit back and do n't NOT_be NOT_too NOT_critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was . If you are not NOT_planning NOT_to NOT_watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one . This film is best watched on the big - screen .", "This book is truly lovely -- about finding friendship in the most unexpected of places .

It 's not NOT_my NOT_job NOT_to NOT_recap NOT_this NOT_century NOT_every NOT_time NOT_i NOT_talk NOT_about NOT_a NOT_new NOT_film , but i 'd like to think that i 'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time . Recently , i 've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others . ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? They are likely to be remembered for . . . Well , quite a while . ? I like this film , too . ? Yes , it 's a disaster - slash - action movie . ? True , its budget is a lot more money than i 'll ever see in my lifetime . ? And there 's not NOT_a NOT_doubt NOT_in NOT_my NOT_mind NOT_that NOT_the NOT_only NOT_reason NOT_it NOT_was NOT_conceived NOT_was NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_money . ? In fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would 've been more profitable . I certainly do n't NOT_care NOT_what NOT_their NOT_intentions NOT_were , NOT_because NOT_michael NOT_bay ( NOT_the NOT_rock ) NOT_is NOT_such NOT_a NOT_skilled NOT_director NOT_that NOT_i NOT_doubt NOT_he NOT_'d NOT_ever NOT_make NOT_a NOT_film NOT_that NOT_is NOT_difficult NOT_to NOT_sit NOT_through . Of course , skillful direction does n't NOT_complete NOT_the NOT_package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . The story is well - thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . Yes , you read that right . Armageddon actually has characters you can care about ! If you do n't NOT_like NOT_this NOT_film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . If you 've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . It turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . So , it 's up to the u. s. government to stop it . ( why the u. s. is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) Their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . The head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . His group of men is a colorful bunch , including a. j. ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . There 's also an interesting triangle formed between a. j. , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry 's daughter . A. j. And grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad is n't NOT_too NOT_happy NOT_with NOT_the NOT_situation . It 's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you 'd like to call armageddon . It 's not NOT_about story -- it 's about viscera and action , and thrills - a - minute , and all that stuff . It 's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds ' thought to what actually happens . But bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . I think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . Take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . A meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . The action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . I like his quick - edit style , because it 's abrasive and exhausting to watch . It 's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . But it 's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . The special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . Deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing NOT_on NOT_armageddon , NOT_and NOT_to NOT_offer NOT_a NOT_comparison NOT_between NOT_the NOT_quality NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film NOT_and NOT_godzilla NOT_is NOT_simply NOT_laughable . Special effects are very important in a film like this : if they 're not NOT_good , then the image is not NOT_convincing , and the film does n't NOT_work . Everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . The effects that do n't NOT_look NOT_totally NOT_real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice - looking that it actually qualifies as art . Of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above - average light show , if i did n't NOT_get NOT_the NOT_feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . The film is two and a half hours long , and not NOT_all NOT_of that is spent submerged in numbing action . Much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters ' subplots . I wo n't NOT_suggest NOT_that NOT_these NOT_are NOT_complex NOT_characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions are n't NOT_put NOT_forth NOT_in a sentimental and overbearing way . In fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that 's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel - good parts of its story . Bruce willis is terrific , and i 'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . Tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . Patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not NOT_wasted NOT_here , NOT_and NOT_the NOT_minor NOT_subplot NOT_revolving NOT_around NOT_his NOT_ex - NOT_wife NOT_and NOT_son NOT_is NOT_very NOT_moving . The comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . I was n't NOT_challenged NOT_to NOT_think NOT_real NOT_hard NOT_while NOT_watching NOT_armageddon , and i do n't NOT_mind NOT_too NOT_much . But the film does n't NOT_insult NOT_my NOT_intelligence -- it 's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . It 's not NOT_mindless NOT_and NOT_escapist , NOT_but NOT_well - NOT_crafted NOT_cinema . It might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . I 'm not NOT_saying NOT_that NOT_films NOT_like NOT_this NOT_are NOT_risky NOT_moves .

The exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity . And as tourism is unfortunately jamaica 's biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation . Life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country . While normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home NOT_without begging tears to the surface . The voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . It guides the audience along a tourist 's journey and the story of the native inhabitants . Instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , \" you do n't NOT_see NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_after NOT_you NOT_flush NOT_the NOT_toilet . \" This engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . This strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . Stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . This is n't NOT_just NOT_another NOT_talking NOT_head NOT_show NOT_of NOT_people NOT_moaning NOT_about NOT_their NOT_horrible NOT_lot NOT_in NOT_life . People are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . The variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or NOT_not . Of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . Officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica 's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . The next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not NOT_the NOT_soil NOT_is NOT_appropriate NOT_for the next agricultural trend the u. s. is forcing on the citizens . Admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business - minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument .

Grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy 's master of the horror thriller dario argento . Boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento . It follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 's . Based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento 's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist - killer . Visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail . At the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints . Posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins . A gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento 's often lumpy narratives . The stendhal syndrome is not NOT_a NOT_simple NOT_cop - NOT_hunting - NOT_killer NOT_scenario . It is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character 's psychological disintegration . The script explores its psycho - sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers . But as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years . Argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences . Effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent . The film 's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real - time with tremendous style . Proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world 's most exhilarating filmmakers . The cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless . Asia argento 's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating . It 's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts . Thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna 's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest . But perhaps the stendhal syndrome 's single most striking element is ennio morricone 's soundtrack . Active since the 1960 's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts . It 's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards . It 's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together . This is a long welcome reunion . If the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film does n't NOT_quite NOT_reach NOT_a NOT_completely NOT_satisfying NOT_climax . But by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento 's career . * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can .

Nearly 30 years later I still own the original vinyl ( the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover . )   I am glad to have it now on CD , the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable .   I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann over Crane , for really , it IS after all Vincent Crane 's project ( Crane , also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown . )   A keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest influences and I hold great admiration for his playing .

Has the hunter become the hunted ? Sleeping With Strangers is a smartly written , great reading drama / thriller that showcases Dickey 's talent .   He blended success , style and heartlessness .   Then he added some ruthlessness , deceit and trickery .   Let 's not NOT_forget NOT_murder , mayhem and steamy sex scenes .   My hiatus is officially over .   I enjoyed SWS .

Summoning up the audacity to fall in love is a harder job . If you 're a total jerk like melvin udall is , the odds are even more against you . Melvin ( jack nicholson ) is a successful romance author who is just the opposite of what you would expect someone in that profession to be . A solitary man hidden away in his new york apartment with no NOT_human NOT_interaction and not NOT_even NOT_a NOT_hint of ever having been in a passionate relationship , he avoids the outside world as much as possible . His obsessive - compulsive disorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands and refuses to step on a crack on the sidewalk . ( there 's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _ very_small _ mosaic tiles . ) Melvin has some great lines . When his publisher 's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds \" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability . \" Do n't NOT_get NOT_him NOT_wrong , he 's not NOT_merely NOT_a NOT_misogynist . Setting his sights higher than that , he 's also a homophobe , racist , anti - semite , xenophobe , animal - hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors . When we first meet him , he 's busy dumping a neighbor 's dog down the garbage chute . He 's an equal opportunity bigot . He does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe . Melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him . And she 's none NOT_too NOT_happy NOT_about NOT_it . When carol does n't NOT_show NOT_up NOT_for work , melvin 's routine is shot and he 's determined to do something about it . Tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast . The fact that she 's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son does n't NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_phase him , he wants his food . Much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery . This does n't NOT_upset NOT_melvin NOT_much ( \" NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_worry , NOT_you NOT_'ll NOT_be back on your knees in no time \" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon 's dog , his life is turned topsy - turvey . Melvin is sequestered because he 's afraid of what 's out there on the other side of his apartment door . He has to make sure it 's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side . When he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes . This little crack in his emotional armor opens him up . Hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son . He even develops a friendship with simon . All three people are heavily damaged . Melvin has retreated from life in his apartment . Carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him . Simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out . A more unlikely trio to form relationships , you 'd rarely see . And in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments . Melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice . \" you make me want to be a better man , \" he tells her . One of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon . Carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him . It only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t - shirt contest . There 's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson . I do n't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over - the - edge melvin is no disappointment . Nicholson may be the best actor working today . Hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson 's energy . She is n't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run - down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top - notch . Their on - screen chemistry is a bit odd . Each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there 's something a little off . It 's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four - star film . Director james l. brooks ( \" terms of endearment \" , \" broadcast news \" ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands . \" as good as it gets \" is n't exactly the quality that the title says , but it 's pretty darn close .

Michael 's love affair with Ira 's lyrics , his reckless abandon to the light - hearted spirit of the familiar -- and   lesser known --phrases , more than makes up for the less polished vocal   production in this early album .   In fact , it is that very element that   sells these songs as I 've never heard them elsewhere .   Michael pulls out   all stops , embracing the less - than - lily - white additional verses of   & quot;Embraceable You&quot ; , with the unbridled passion of a first time   lover .

Go Envogue G", "At one point during brian de palma 's crime epic scarface , the radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino and pops a question that the audience has no NOT_doubt been wanting to ask for themselves : \" ca n't NOT_you NOT_stop NOT_saying ' NOT_fuck ' NOT_all NOT_the NOT_time ? \" Fucking good question , that . It may not NOT_be NOT_an NOT_honour NOT_that NOT_instills NOT_the NOT_filmmakers NOT_with NOT_pride , but as far as i can tell oliver stone 's script contains the said expletitive more times than any other film in cinema history . Yet it would be a shame if bad language is all de palma 's scarface is remembered for , because this is a damn fine gangstar flick . The overall structure is similar to howard hawks ' 1932 original , but this time the scene has switched to miami , florida and our anti - hero 's chosen vice is cocaine traffiking . Pacino , sporting a thick cuban accent , gives one the best performances of his career ( golden globe nominated ) as tony montana , a cuban refugee with a criminal past who flees castro and comes to america to live the american dream . And live it out he does , with lashings of violence , abuse , murder and the funny white powder . From his earliest jobs as a drug runner for various middlemen , tony montana makes it clear to everyone he meets that he 's not NOT_a NOT_man to be fucked ( sorry ) . Soon he 's the king of the cocaine heap , but his hot head and an increasingly out of control drug addiction prove his undoing . \" never do your own stash \" , warns one character early in the film . As sure as night follows day , the emperor of miami eventually falls . Writer oliver stone and director brian de palma make an explosive combination here . Stone 's script offers solid storytelling and some fine character development . Montana is fascinating ; uneducated but calculating , a straight shooter who speaks from the heart ; an ambitious , violent man yet one with a conscience . A man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year old sister , not NOT_wanting NOT_her NOT_to NOT_be NOT_sucked into the glitzy , dangerous world which he inhabits . Pacino is dynamite , taking to the role with a brooding , bristling energy which in his more recent films has often degenerated into just simple overracting . Pfeiffer also registers strongly as the gangstar mole with no NOT_inner NOT_life . Only once does tony express real affection for her and his desire to have children , and even then you sense all he really wants is a regular screw and a beautiful object to show off to his friends , and she 's happy to oblige . This is n't NOT_as NOT_meaty NOT_a NOT_role NOT_for NOT_pfieffer NOT_as NOT_sharon NOT_stone NOT_'s NOT_was NOT_in NOT_casino , but its an effective one nonetheless and she aquits herself well . As director , de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his typical stylistic brauva . The escalating tension he creates in various mob situations - a drug deal gone wrong , an assination attempt - is often thrilling , and in this respect he is every bit the equal of scorese and coppola . Where he differs from , say , coppola 's godfather trilogy is in his overall treatment . Coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep , whereas in scarface de palma opts for a grittier feel . And it perfectly suits the material . The only major botch is giorgio moroder 's mostly crap synthesier score . It 's just not NOT_right , NOT_and NOT_unfortunately NOT_compromises NOT_the NOT_impact NOT_of NOT_some NOT_otherwise NOT_good NOT_scenes . As expected , scarface is very violent at times , but you should n't NOT_be NOT_watching NOT_gangster NOT_movies NOT_if NOT_that NOT_upsets NOT_you . At over two and a half hours in length it 's a true epic , and if you 're a fan of the genre you 'll love f * * k - filled minute of it .", "Superb Hotel .

It combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie . It 's an italian film , but do n't NOT_let NOT_that NOT_discourage you . Subtitle - phobes will be missing a wonderful experience . Life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle . The year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . Their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she 's already engaged to another man . Can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ? What do you think ? However , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy . The fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp . Unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp . He pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet . As you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them . As a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny . As a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching . Roberto benigni 's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin 's , and it is easy to see why . He is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm - hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero 's \" triumph of the underdog \" spirit . Life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust . However , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , NOT_without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor NOT_without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears . With life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy . It 's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i 've had at the movies this year .", "Bob the happy bastard 's quickie review : I must admit , no NOT_doubt NOT_'s NOT_single \" NOT_new \" is quite catchy . It was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back . The result ? A movie that 's just as good as that song , really . It follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend . First we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he 's been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop 's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) . Really , it 's all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . The movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product . The dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not NOT_going NOT_for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending . Think of it as a , well , ending . The intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it 's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did . However , it 's better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda NOT_is n't .", "A wonderful place to stay .

Despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department .

Not NOT_much better is qui - gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi - wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . Also fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian ' theory , which claims that micro - organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe .

The rationale : To create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition . With pressing needs for superior innovation . And improved productivity . Amid ever - leaner budgets . ( Sound familiar?)Flash forward a dozen years to today and IDEAS ARE FREE ( a title echoing Phil Crosby 's classic QUALITY IS FREE ) . This new book makes clear today that my impassioned plea from a decade ago failed to eradicate idea - stifling organizational cultures . Way too many work places , it seems , still quell expressions of innovative thinking by both frontline employees and middle managers . So the case for turning on the innovation spigot needs to be made again with renewed vigor . In answering that call , Professors Robinson & Schroeder offer some worthwhile and occasionally surprising and compelling contributions to this topic that is as relevant now as ever . IDEAS ARE FREE presents an articulate case that organizations -- and individual managers -- need to unleash the * still * largely untapped brainpower intentionally and quite unfortunately held - back by employees . Three elements make IDEAS ARE FREE especially worthy of your time and money.1 . The authors aim their advice at regular workaday managers . Sure , they rightfully point out how organizational systems are often \" dysfunctional . \" And they make the case that many corporate practices actually * discourage * creative contributions by individuals even as they try to * incent * those very behaviors . But Robinson & Schroeder do n't NOT_aim NOT_their NOT_prescriptions NOT_at NOT_policy - NOT_making NOT_top NOT_executives NOT_only . Many chapters conclude with what the authors term \" guerilla tactics \" -- clear directives for simple actions that even frontline supervisors can put to work \" NOT_without the boss 's permission . \" 2 . The book dramatically makes the case that paying for ideas -- as part of an organization 's formal suggestion systems -- is fraught with potential negative side - effects . My own corporate experience as an executive championing a newly installed suggestion system bears out the startling reality that this well - intentioned process can turn into a self - destructive minefield . ( And , let the record show , I largely missed this dimension in covering suggestion systems back in my ' 92 work.)3 . Many interesting , well - developed ( albeit occasionally dated ) anecdotes illustrate the book 's sound principles . They help make IDEAS ARE FREE a grounded , engaging , and palatable read . Back in ' 92 , I suggested in my book MAVERICKS ! that , \" Managers should be asking questions like : What is the value of a useful new idea ? If one good idea leads to another , where could thousands and thousands lead us ? What is the cost to the organization for not NOT_tapping NOT_the NOT_endlessly NOT_renewable NOT_resource of ideas in our employees ' heads ? \" Getting to the root of the problem , I asked : \" Is n't NOT_the NOT_job NOT_of NOT_a NOT_manager NOT_to * NOT_recognize and choose * from lots of great ideas generated by fellow work associates ? \" And answered : \" Unfortunately , most managers -- even those who claim they invite suggestions from their people -- subscribe to the time - honored myth that a manager 's job is to * have * the ideas . \"In 2004 , Robinson & Schroeder again plow many of these very same themes ( and cite data that also have been around for a long time ) . Still , this book explores afresh the opportunities that arise from drawing out the best thinking of every employee . And it presents realistic tactics that all managers can deploy to effectively deal with these still - critical issues . Wherever you sit in the hierarchy , read IDEAS ARE FREE to seize powerful ideas about potential gains for your organization 's progress and prosperity .

We were thrilled with the room size . We booked a quadruple-1 king - size bed and 2 twins along the walls . Bathroom was small but sparkling clean . Staff was courteous and helpful . We arrived very early in the morning . before 8 . and they kept our luggage while we walked to Castel Sant Angelo and sightseeing until checkin time . Breakfast was adequate . after the first day . I learned NOT to drink the regular coffee but to ask the waiter for a freshly made cappuccino - that was excellent . the regular coffee was horrible . I would go back -- in 2002 we paid only . 200 for all 4 of us .", "What a find .   I stayed here with my husband and two teenagers on the last night of our holiday before flying home . The hotel is a gem . It 's small but it 's very clean and well cared for . I read previous reviews of this hotel and hoped that people were not NOT_exaggerating . I need not NOT_have NOT_worried . We had a double and a twin room which they located close to each other for us and the rooms were very well furnished . The beds were the most comfortable of our entire trip and the rooms had air conditioning . minibar and satellite tv . with BBC World - our first english telly of the holiday . . The bathrooms were spotless and of a good size with a great shower and lovely tiling . The hotel has its own small car park around the back . which is watched from Reception via CCTV . The staff were really helpful . They told us how to get from the hotel to centre of Pisa . although we got a little lost trying to follow the map the hotel provided . this is my only moan .   They also recommended a great little restaurant . Pizzeria Galileo .   for an evening meal which they then booked for us because they only serve breakfast . We needed a 24 hour chemist and they told us of one close by . The hotel is about 15 minutes walk from centre of Pisa and is only about 5 - 10 minutes drive from the airport which made the morning departure really simple It was a great end to our holiday .", "Pest Control is a light - hearted book which uses a fast pace and off - the - wall humor to make up for any depth problems .

Of course Fitzhugh answers with simple and hilarious solutions which are , towards the end of the book , more and more absurd and predictable . Overall , I 'm slightly embarrassed that I like this book as much as do .

This book is both thought - provoking and accessible . Thich Nhat Hanh   has a way of presenting Buddhist lessons and ways of being , ways of living and thinking about ourselves and our relationships to others and the world in a style that is almost deceptively simple and deeply thoughtful .

Analog sound was at its peak when these records were made in 1976 and 77 and DG has done an excellent job of remastering them for CD . But beyond that Karajan simply \" gets \" the composer -- as another reviewer pointed out -- and conducts with an intensity and passion he seldom showed in his other recordings and performances . I'm listening to these discs once more on a massive sound system with doubled speakers to handle the ' 70s Kenwood beast amplifier and love it more than ever . As a reviewer once said of a classic Szell / Cleveland performance of Beethoven 's Third , this is a reading of \" blinding virtuosity and strength . \" As a budget two disc set it is also , incredibly enough , cheaper than those old DG import records we bought ( and scratched up ) one by one in the seventies . As I 've said before , when you listen to a disc like this you realize why you went nuts for this kind of music in the first place .

Actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . Well the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror / comedies they are . I will admit that ' lake placid ' is n't NOT_an NOT_oscar NOT_worthy NOT_film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . Bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . She gets there but really does n't NOT_understand NOT_why NOT_she NOT_is there . Bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . What they find though is n't NOT_great . A huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . They have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . Betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you 'll have to see the movie to find out . Her character is very funny and foul - mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . To me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . With the opening sequence , and some others , it is not NOT_original NOT_and NOT_is . When you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . David e. kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job .

But believe me , do n't NOT_take ' NOT_lake NOT_placid ' NOT_too NOT_seriously NOT_or NOT_you NOT_wo NOT_n't NOT_like NOT_it . But it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun ' popcorn ' type movie .

There 's really not NOT_that NOT_much NOT_gore , NOT_but NOT_what NOT_there NOT_is NOT_might NOT_seem NOT_kinda NOT_gross NOT_to NOT_some .

This is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . Old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . Through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . What results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not NOT_claiming NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be NOT_wrong , and that they could really benefit . After all , old ned wo n't NOT_miss NOT_it . Rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i 'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . Bannen and kelly are a perfect pair . One slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . Both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . Waking ned devine may even be seen as a \" full monty \" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff - o for one amusing scene . Waking ned devine is by no NOT_means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . The performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . There is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly NOT_ruins NOT_the NOT_picture . Writer / director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . Scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not NOT_the NOT_exception . Perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . Had i held off on my year 's best / worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year 's finest films .

One afternoon while we were relaxing in our room . a bell hop brought us a complimentary plate of delicous fruits to enjoy . The hotel is a bit far out of the center of town but their shuttle service was very convenient and always prompt . Plus it was so nice to come back to a nice quiet and safe neighborhood .

Makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the Cantos -- periplous , ideogram , fugue , the ' repeat in history'--and gives concise readings of individual sections   that helped my understanding enormously .   He does an especially good job of   connecting Pound 's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity .    Makin manages to be critical of Pound while treating his ideas with verve   and sympathy ;   the writing is colloquial , witty and jargon - free .

Second , the blending of idealism and realism is thorough and complex , they are not NOT_either - NOT_or NOT_options .

Or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra - terrestrial ? I used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey . But after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions . As the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth . The men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty - tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars . Based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space - faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed . But to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast . They carry other - worldly technology to erase people 's short - term memory when common folk see the mib in action . And their best leads on cosmic things - gone - awry are the supermarket tabloids . Little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v. evil going on in the depths of space . One of the aliens - as - human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious . It holds the ' key ' , literally , to universal peace . A giant cockroach - like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this ' key ' . In the wrong alien hands ( flippers ? Mandibles ? Tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon . Therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it 's rightful owners . Otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the ' key ' . Now , it 's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe . The mib agents on the case are \" k \" , played by tommy lee jones . He is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore . The stars in the sky no NOT_longer spark wonder in his eyes . He is accompanied by a flippant rookie , \" j \" , played by will smith . But , despite this shoot - em - up , protect - earth - from - destruction premise , this is nothing NOT_at NOT_all NOT_like NOT_a NOT_typical NOT_summer NOT_action NOT_movie . And , this is n't NOT_an NOT_independence NOT_day NOT_knockoff . Rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci - fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up . But to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth - hangs - in - the - balance scenario . Yet , this movie is very appealing . The abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee - wee atomizers , a mortician who ' lives ' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime - splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) . It gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder . Jones plays the venerable seen - it - all agent with seriousness and maturity . Smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones ' straight man routine . They click like dorothy 's ruby red shoes . The look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam 's family ) . This guy has a knack for ' gothic ' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen . And , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task NOT_without diverting attention from the human actors . The story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling ! The result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows . Let the men in black protect and color your world .", "If there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it 's their predictable endings . The devil 's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does . Unfortunately for the devil 's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film . Nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) . I do n't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_was NOT_quite NOT_prepared NOT_for NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_because NOT_the NOT_trailers NOT_made NOT_it NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_be NOT_some NOT_supernatural NOT_horror NOT_film NOT_about NOT_satan . Well , it does contain this element , but what is not NOT_mentioned NOT_in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) . The devil 's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session . Kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl . He ends up with a not - NOT_guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) . He leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury . He accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife . After proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer . He graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god . He is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck . His life seems to be on the rise . And of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline . He is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment . Mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not NOT_wanted . Meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t. nelson ) who apparently murdered three people . He spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not NOT_be NOT_going NOT_insane . All of this while john milton may or may not NOT_be NOT_the NOT_devil himself . After a while , things turn completely upside - down , as kevin 's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends . A fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin 's real father . Is it all just a big nightmare ? Or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin 's life ? The devil 's advocate plays out fairly straight - forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we do n't NOT_expect . Is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home NOT_without feeling depressed or disturbed ? If so , the devil 's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early . I went into the devil 's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got . I was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got . But what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i did n't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_ending ? ) . The producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you . Films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less . We know it is going to end in an unpredictable way . The devil 's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not NOT_from NOT_us NOT_knowing NOT_a NOT_lot , NOT_but NOT_knowing NOT_nothing NOT_at NOT_all . If that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again . As for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study . The film runs like a well - built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) . And then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur . It was at this point that i felt cheated . Taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film . Everything occurs from his perspective . He is our representation on screen ( sort of ) . But we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game . I do n't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself . Perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil 's advocate is the extreme amount of everything . It earned its r rating for a reason . There is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity . This film really is n't subtle about anything , showing us everything . It actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh . However , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those . I do n't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it . The biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch . The confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann . Portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann 's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline . This may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her . She is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted . Something the devil 's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature . The story actually has something to say about humanity . In one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) . He comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity . Then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature . This semi - religious bashing is more humorous than frightening . What milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true . These moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil 's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i 'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) . When a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched . The cast of the devil 's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we do n't expect . Heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job . Probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves . He has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance . I have never seen him more believable to date . Al pacino is of course the scene stealer . His devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) . He could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) . Jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller 's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon . Judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin 's past . Connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times . One familiar face with a twist was \" coach \" star , craig t. nelson , who gives a very good performance . The devil 's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore . At 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly . For the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters . The technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score . Director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes . I guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time . But just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream . Personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .", "A superb hotel .

A soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation - state against another . A common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain . A terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end . If the target nation does not NOT_affect NOT_the NOT_desired NOT_change in policy , the violence continues . It is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label . Edward zwick 's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states . You 'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines . Arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u. s. responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack . However , unlike the real - life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden 's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal . In retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world . Unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent - in - charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau 's new york office at one federal plaza . While investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information . Generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u. s. , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm . Even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country . Hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government . The original tagline for patriot games was , \" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . \" However true , it was pulled before the movie 's release because it sounded too much like a dare . Revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america . Admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who 's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two - thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid . I liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action - thriller fare of good guy g - men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order . It provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab - american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself . In fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk . Although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not NOT_be beneath many international terrorist groups . Throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully . What results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides . It actually gets rather heady at times , but it 's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they do n't NOT_underestimate NOT_the NOT_intelligence of the audience . I do n't NOT_know NOT_if NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_his NOT_tone NOT_or NOT_inflection NOT_or NOT_something NOT_else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great . This , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid - level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable . Annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i 've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable . It 's somewhat unfortunate that her character 's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range . Bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough - guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face . However , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film 's development . Notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant . The role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society . Difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch . Perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom \" wings , \" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night . Whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick 's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer . I therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score - writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian - themed music , and horner 's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish - sounding at most . Revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole . It 's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we 've been getting throughout the year . Missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes . For example , it 's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick . Unfortunately , there 's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye - catching . In the middle of the city ( and against no NOT_real NOT_opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no NOT_farther NOT_than NOT_50 NOT_feet from friendly troops . Verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point . The film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along . A noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously . These flaws are glaring , but they do n't NOT_detract NOT_too NOT_much NOT_from NOT_an NOT_otherwise NOT_good NOT_film NOT_that NOT_makes NOT_you NOT_think NOT_about NOT_issues NOT_you NOT_may NOT_not NOT_have NOT_considered NOT_since NOT_history NOT_class .", "If you 're a Strummer fan who is an historical completist then you 'll want this disc .

This slow - moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not NOT_have NOT_wide NOT_commercial NOT_appeal . When the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open - and - shut murder case . Upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores ' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . As the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores ' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . Did dolores kill her husband ? And did she kill her employer ? Dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . Consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood 's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . Kathy bates plays the film 's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . Dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . She dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . Kathy bates ' performance is award - calibre stuff . The rest of the cast is also very good . Jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores ' ever - present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . David strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores ' husband , joe st . george . Judy parfitt is fine as dolores ' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan -- it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . Child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . The direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . The segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit - and - miss in terms of effectiveness . The pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . However , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful -- i particularly like the chilling ice - blue hue permeating the present - day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots -- and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . It would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . None NOT_of NOT_the NOT_performers NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_could NOT_be NOT_classified NOT_as NOT_a NOT_big NOT_draw , and its pacing may be a turn - off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe - wielding psychopaths . Although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . Dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . However , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . On my four - star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars .", "Pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics , providing examples of practical application of each .

Forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i 've seen so far this year . Even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there 's a not NOT_drop NOT_of NOT_blood NOT_to NOT_be NOT_seen . Luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton 's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re - released in october 2001 . So , there 's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place . Robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash . His newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $ 10 , 000 somewhere . Powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he 's released and ben is hanged . But finding the money is n't NOT_easy NOT_for NOT_powell , NOT_who NOT_must NOT_contend NOT_with NOT_his NOT_stepchildren ( NOT_billy NOT_chapin NOT_and NOT_sally NOT_jane NOT_bruce ) , NOT_who NOT_know NOT_where NOT_the NOT_money NOT_is , NOT_but NOT_are NOT_n't NOT_telling . The hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time . How many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ? What about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ? ( no , i 'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . ) Yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter . Powell 's \" love \" and \" hate \" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) . And powell 's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino 's early visual style . Seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact . You can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club . He plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears . He 's like the senior class president with an evil streak . If i ever need to stay awake , i 'll just picture him crooning , \" leaning ... Leaning .... \" Any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah . And credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression - era backdrop . It 's a testament to both men that they 're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we 're more scared by what we do n't see . Screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who 's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act . The only lapse is the movie 's third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible - reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) . Her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns . However , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it 's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun . Do yourself favor and do n't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater . Note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie . The highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters ' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile . Hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling . Screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) .", "This is the best CD I have ever listened to ! I highly recommend i", "\" when it 's cold , molecules are n't NOT_moving . Everything is clean . \" These are the essential words of mikey carver ( elijah wood ) , a young teenage boy living in 1973 new canaan , connecticut in the ice storm . When mikey delivers these words to a bored science class , it is unlikely that anyone realizes how much they parallel mikey 's life and the lives that surround him . His father jim ( jamey sheridan ) is rarely seen and his mother janey ( sigourney weaver ) is having an affair with married neighbor ben hood ( kevin kline ) . Ben 's wife elena ( joan allen ) suspects the affair , but does n't NOT_say NOT_anything . Meanwhile , ben 's 14-year - old daughter wendy ( christina ricci ) continuously lures mikey and his younger brother sandy ( adam hann - byrd ) into sexual explorations . Tobey maguire plays paul hood , the 16-year - old narrator of the story who also happens to be the least prevalent character . We start the film with an interesting outlook on family from paul . He compares family to the fantastic four comic book , and even goes so far as to say that family is everybody 's own anti - matter ; something everybody will return to eventually , and the farther you go , the deeper you 'll return . The ice storm is a character piece that explores a dismal time both in america , and in the individual lives portrayed in the movie . Everything parallels everything else . The young teenagers trying to discover who they are thru drugs , sex , and alcohol is really almost identical to the parents trying to figure out the purpose in their own lives using the same methods . \" when it 's cold outside , the molecules are n't NOT_moving . Everything is clean . \" Everything is clean because nobody will admit what 's going on . Even the president is on tv denying his wrong - doings . How can you expect anything more out of a couple of suburban families riding the coattails of sexual revolution ? All the sex and drugs is so obviously empty , and i think that 's the point of the film . At first viewing , the entire movie might seem empty , but then why should n't NOT_it NOT_parallel itself ? You do n't NOT_get NOT_to NOT_know NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_very NOT_deeply , but i think that 's because nobody in the movie knows each other either . We sadly watch two families go about their lives nearly oblivious to one another . At first glance , you might think emotion is lost in the ending scenes because you have n't NOT_gotten NOT_to NOT_know the characters well enough to sympathize - then you realize that just might be the point , and then you do feel the pain . The acting by all is quite good , but i particularly liked elijah wood . He does n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_receiving NOT_as NOT_much NOT_recognition NOT_as NOT_the NOT_others , but i still found him to possess quite a real sense of being . Christina ricci is being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something more to her life in the pants of every available boy . Still , i say hats off remain to wood , joan allen 's subtle but believable performance as a lonely , unappreciated wife , and the always excellent kevin kline . Tobey maguire did a fine job , but his character which , perhaps , was the most intact , sensible person in the story , seemed a little lost . He was needed , but perhaps he should 've been used more . The ice storm is being hailed by many as one of the best films of the year . I hate to say that i do n't NOT_agree , but i do n't . In fact , i can think of many other films that i would rank higher than this one . Even so , it is a very good film . It takes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it 's art , but when you finally start seeing things in it that you did n't NOT_before , you start to grow even fonder of the characters and the story . Perhaps this is one to see , ponder , and then watch again with different eyes .", "No NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_you NOT_suspect , this is n't NOT_your NOT_usual NOT_action NOT_thriller . The usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up - and - coming director bryan singer . It 's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid - fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light . Plot twists a - go - go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me . Keyser soze is a name you 'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason . It 's not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- \" keyser soze \" in latin means \" an intelligent crime mystery story from up - and - coming director bryan singer . \" Or maybe i should n't NOT_have NOT_bought NOT_a NOT_foreign - NOT_language NOT_dictionary NOT_from NOT_the NOT_same NOT_company NOT_that NOT_makes NOT_those NOT_99-cent NOT_encyclopedias NOT_sold NOT_in NOT_supermarkets . At the movie 's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \\ f \" times new roman \" \\ s 10 \\ h } for his performance in the movie ) . Verbal is so - named because he frequently rambles on about anything or NOT_nothing . He also earns his name as the movie 's narrator , spouting memorable lines like \" the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did n't NOT_exist \" ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z 's in their name is okay in my book ) . We see the story unfold as spacey retells it . The five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car . It 's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they ca n't NOT_refuse . Namely , they have to destroy soze 's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $ 91 million cash . Spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent \" cripple \" character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast . The usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion . I suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv . A different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _ murder _ mystery if that video ever comes on again ...", "Though no NOT_book will make you a filmmaker , some will help you refine your vision .

Now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist Cecil Taylor are resurfacing , like \" Jumpin ' Punkins \" and now \" The World of Cecil Taylor . \" It is my opinion that Taylor 's currently unavailable ( at least domestically ) \" New York City R&B \" and \" World of C.T. \" are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early 60s . \" World , \" recorded over two successive days in October 1960 , is basically a trio date , with Buell Neidlinger on bass and Dennis Charles on drums , and Archie Shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks , \" Air \" and the standard \" Lazy Afternoon . \" This disc is one of Shepp 's first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with Taylor 's music -- I recall the now out of print Mosaic set of this material collecting some 15 plus outtakes of \" Air . \" But the master takes are truly masterful , and I am delighted that with this CD available once again , we can all return to \" The World of Cecil Taylor .", "loved this hotel . Had a 3 night stay at this excellent hotel and ca nt say anything negative Hotel is clean and comfortable breakfirst has a choice for everbody . the staff is extremely helpful and knowledgable NOT_Nothing seems to much for them . You ask they help it is as easy as that .

If anyone is the genuine article , it is Jimmie . Listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including \" Frankie and Johnny \" , \" Mule Skinner Blues \" and \" T for Texas \" .   There are also fine versions of \" Waitin ' for A Train \" and \" In the Jailhouse Now \" though some may prefer Jerry Lee Lewis ' version of the former and the Webb Pierce recording of the latter . The most interesting tracks are less well known .   These include \" My Old Pal \" , \" My Old Sunny South by the Sea \" and one devoted not NOT_to NOT_a NOT_mother but a father ( ! ) -\"Daddy and Home \" . For this reviewer , the album hit its high point on the final track , a mournful \" TB Blues \" , a reference to the disease that took Jimmie 's life at 35 . While Jimmie 's yodeling style may not NOT_be NOT_for everyone , this reviewer considers this album a safe bet .   Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   Further , the \" Essential \" series of albums rarely disappoints . These almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts . \" The Essential Jimmie Rodgers \" certainly falls into that category", "As a fan of both celtic traditional and bluegrass music I was wary of a CD claiming to be a hybrid - too often it means an unsatisfactory compromise where original flavours become watered down and insipid . I need not NOT_have NOT_worried - Tim O'Brien has produced one of the most amazing and rewarding musical journeys I 've followed for some time . Not NOT_only NOT_do the players from the two traditions blend instinctively and harmoniously but the tracks , mostly songs , are marvellous vehicles for new and exciting directions . There are superb performances all round , vocally from O'Brien with guests Paul Brady , Maura O'Connell , Kathhy Mattea , Del McCoury etc and musicians Altan , Frankie Gavin , Jerry Douglas , Earl Scruggs , Seamus Egan and a host of others and the sound is fresh , acoustic and vital , requiring no NOT_production NOT_gimmicks NOT_or NOT_effects . Standout songs for me personally are & quot;Mountaineer is Always Free&quot ; , & quot;Lost Little Children&quot ; , & quot;Wandering&quot ; and & quot;John Riley&quot ; although there is not NOT_a NOT_weak NOT_track on the CD . It is obvious that for Tim O'Brien this has been a labour of love . If you like acoustic music , from any tradition , either side of the Atlantic , you 'll love it . Several of my friends have bought it on my recommendation and agree it is brilliant", "Excellent Hotel . We stayed at this hotel for just the one night in November following reviews on trip advisor and were not NOT_disappointed We booked the car pick up through the hotel also which was expensive . cheaper to get a cab . but the standard of car on pick up from the airport was fantastic . unfortunately the return trip to the airport was slightly disappointing as despite paying 95euros we had to return in a mini - bus .

I thoroughly enjoyed the inside look at Brian Boitano 's career , from start to present .    It 's easy to read , so one can browse through it   like a newspaper or magazine ..... but it 's also stuffed full of valuable   information about the technical aspects of skating and the & quot;behind the   scenes&quot ; preparation activities for competitive skaters .

Hats off to Brian Boitano , Suzanne Harper , and all the people who   helped create this treasure for my coffee table", "Quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . After his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . John travolta made his come - back and is now one of today 's most bankable stars . Bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . Jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . Most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she 's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert - written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . That is , until now . Jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . After mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . Jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . Despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . Pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent -- samuel l. jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . More than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . Describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really ca n't NOT_say much or you spoil it for everyone else . I will tread lightly . Jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . The camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . We are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers ... For a hefty price . Ms. brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . However , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l. a. cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . They try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell 's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . They try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong - doing . But after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell 's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . Ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . After she claims to have said NOT_nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . Ordell does n't NOT_like NOT_this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . This scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not NOT_foul NOT_up NOT_their NOT_goal . Revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that 's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . Tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . His hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . They talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . Of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . And perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . Of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs - style storytelling to it . Things are told from one person 's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . This all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . On the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . However , this time around it is n't NOT_as NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_impressive NOT_or NOT_original . The writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino 's use of slang terms offensive . The story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it 's much more easy to understand . His previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the \" leaps \" in time . Perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel \" rum punch \" by elmore leonard . The dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . The cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . And as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . The acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . The performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters ' actions . Nothing NOT_is NOT_quite NOT_as NOT_it NOT_seems , and you ca n't NOT_really NOT_tell NOT_which NOT_side NOT_one NOT_person NOT_is NOT_on . The real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . Her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . Watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i did n't NOT_know what she was thinking . Her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . Bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . I did n't NOT_even NOT_realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham 's in boogie nights ) . Michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . Chris tucker has a small , but effective performance . Samuel l. jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . But no NOT_matter ... Jackson is very strong in his role . Robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell 's perspective clients and friends . Robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . He is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . Jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . As a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . However , one can not NOT_help NOT_but NOT_compare NOT_it NOT_to NOT_tarantino NOT_'s NOT_pulp NOT_fiction , NOT_and NOT_expect NOT_great NOT_results . When compared , it comes up short , but not NOT_that short . It 's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . Perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . I ca n't NOT_remember NOT_seeing NOT_her NOT_in NOT_anything ( NOT_except NOT_for NOT_a NOT_small NOT_role NOT_in NOT_mars NOT_attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . Expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) .", "I just saw this woman live and she 's amazing ! ! ! !

If anyone knows , would you mind posting it under the reviews here ? Thanx that would be great !", "Many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career .   For Peter Gabriel , every album is an experiment .   Usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm ; however , on Gabriel 's fifth experiment , SO , the ex - Genesis frontman does the exact opposite .   Gabriel , beloved for always doing something different , decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel , that is an experiment .   Previously he was a sort of cult performer , but on SO , Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight .   Big time .   SO was an immense success , peaking at number one on the Billboard Top 100 , receiving overwhelmingly - positive reviews ( in 2003 , So placed 187th on Rolling Stone 's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time ) , and resulting in a sold - out tour . Which brings us to one nagging term : \" sellout \" . \t Though most who loved Peter Gabriel 's first four albums loved SO as well , there are still many who call SO Gabriel 's sellout album .   To me , that 's just foolishness .   Peter Gabriel has never \" sold out \" and I have no NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_he NOT_never NOT_will .   It 's clear that on SO he was trying to go in a more mainstream direction , but that 's probably the biggest experiment Gabriel has ever undertaken , save for his subsequent release , PASSION .   One popular theory amongst Gabriel fans is that the album 's title , SO , is in fact an acronym for \" Sell Out \" ( hence the uppercase capital \" S \" and the lowercase italicized \" o \" ) .   I would n't NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_at NOT_all NOT_if NOT_it NOT_was . \t SO does sound very different from Gabriel 's earlier albums ( though then again , NOT_none of those sounded alike either ) .   If anything , it resembles Gabriel 's third self - titled release , nicknamed MELT .   The thing that really separates those two - other than an obviously more commercial sound on SO - is a feeling of warmth on that album , unlike the harsh , gritty darkness of MELT .   Perhaps that 's why listeners found SO so charming . \t What does SO have to offer ?   Well , a lot .   For one thing , there 's the atmospheric opening , \" Red Rain \" , one of Gabriel 's finest tracks .   Like many of the tracks on the album , it 's dominated by ethereal guitar from David Rhodes and heavenly synthesizers , courtesy of Gabriel himself .   Then there 's one of the biggest hits of 1980s ( which also spawned what may be the best music video in history ) , \" Sledgehammer , \" inspired by the motown music Gabriel listened to as a child .   With its pounding , industrial percussion , playful bass ( by Gabriel 's exclusive bass man , Tony Levin ) and clever , sexually suggestive lyrics , it 's no NOT_surprise NOT_that \" NOT_Sledgehammer \" NOT_was a hit .   After letting his silly side out , Gabriel tries to inspire with \" Do n't NOT_Give NOT_Up \" , NOT_a NOT_nice NOT_song made great by heavenly vocals from another popular 80s musician , Kate Bush . \t The subsequent track , \" That Voice Again \" , is my personal favorite song from this album .   It features some excellent drumming from Manu Katche , an immensely - talented drummer who has also played with artists like Sting , along with misty guitars , delightful synthesizers , and fine lyrics hit home by Gabriel 's pained singing .   Like the best tracks on SO , \" That Voice Again \" manages to be fun , moody , uplifting , powerful , warm , and inspirational , all at once . \t Gabriel winds down a little for the dreamy , powerful \" Mercy Street \" , a song inspired by and written about Anne Sexton , an American mental patient who relieved her depression through writing .   As on his previous albums , Gabriel proves that he knows when to lighten up by whipping out \" Big Time \" , a silly but fun track which also spawned an innovative music video .   \" Big Time \" features heavy drumming from Stewart Copeland , the former drummer of The Police , as well as some awesome CMI by Simon Clark .   \" We Do What We 're Told ( Miligram 's 37 ) \" is about the experiments of Yale professor Stanley Milgram .   Milgram would have his subjects administer shocks to actors , who would scream in pain as the shocks became more and more horrible .   Milgram observed that his subjects would do what he told them to do , despite the immense pain they appeared to be inflicting on the actors .   He follows that rather cold song with \" This Is The Picture ( Excellent Birds ) \" , a tensely surreal tune . \t The album closes with one of Gabriel 's most famous songs , \" In Your Eyes \" .   Most people are familiar with the song from its usage in Cameron Crowe 's romantic comedy masterpiece ... SAY ANYTHING , where the song was used in what has become one of the most famous scenes in movie history .   It 's one of Gabriel 's warmest and most romantic compositions , and also one of his best .   On the original LP version of SO , \" We Do What We 're Told \" closed out the album .   That 's a fine way to end it , but it 's also a rather cold way to end such a warm album .   When the album was re - released remastered on CD in 2002 , Gabriel placed \" In Your Eyes \" at the end of the album as he originally intended .   Now that is the way to end it ! \t So - how does SO rank among the many other brilliant works of Peter Gabriel ?   Well , it ranks quite highly , actually .   It 's one of the pinnacles of Gabriel 's career , though whether it truly is the peak or not NOT_is NOT_hard to say .   After all , how can one compare Gabriel 's albums when they are all so vastly different ?   Certainly , though , SO is one of the finest Gabriel masterpieces .   This is fun , well - crafted , emotional music .   SO is SO wonderful .", "( dimension films , \" scream 2 \" 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film 's twisty plot . That 's no NOT_easy NOT_task NOT_considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there 's a first ) . ) \" the first one was [ good ] , but all the rest sucked , \" said a cinematically - savvy teen in last winter 's wes craven thriller \" scream , \" her statement referring to the films of the \" nightmare on elm street \" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general . The comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas . But like it or NOT_not , along comes \" scream 2 . \" and believe it or NOT_not , it 's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood 's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions . \" scream 2 \" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow - up that can stand along side its original with pride . It 's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch - esque get - ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california . Those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives . Plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture - whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along . Trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best - seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called \" stab . \" And dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during \" scream , \" has left his job as a police officer for a while . Life is tranquil ... At least for a while . Several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it 's to trust no NOT_one . Thus , the possible victim / potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney 's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale 's cameraman who 's not NOT_too NOT_thrilled with her blood - soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney 's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not - NOT_too - NOT_friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy 's good friend and fellow film student . Cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother 's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ? Like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang . This time , it 's an extended sequence that finds an african - american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of \" stab , \" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non - roles of blacks in slasher cinema . Before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie - within - a - movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from \" stab \" which turns scream 's now - famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear . ( \" b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! \" Pinkett yells at the screen . ) It 's funny , creepy stuff ( i do n't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_'ll NOT_ever NOT_feel NOT_safe NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_theater NOT_again ) NOT_that NOT_effectively NOT_foreshadows NOT_the NOT_ratio NOT_of NOT_smart NOT_scares NOT_and NOT_spoofy NOT_laughs NOT_down NOT_the NOT_road . Another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone - assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters . There are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect . There are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count . It 's something of a trade - in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully - developed as the original \" scream \" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar . It can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . It certainly does n't NOT_skimp NOT_with NOT_shocks -- NOT_a NOT_major NOT_one NOT_being NOT_the NOT_killing NOT_of NOT_one NOT_cast NOT_member NOT_very NOT_near NOT_and NOT_dear NOT_to NOT_my NOT_heart ( NOT_i NOT_actually NOT_questioned NOT_craven NOT_and NOT_williamson NOT_'s NOT_judgment NOT_here , NOT_considering NOT_how NOT_much NOT_this NOT_person NOT_has NOT_added NOT_to NOT_these NOT_films ) . Sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we 're shown are dead - on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like \" the usual suspects , \" \" aliens \" and \" the empire strikes back . \" Still , \" scream 2 \" does so many things right , it 's petty to quibble . Its penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all . The attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus . And the denouement ( while not NOT_as NOT_shocking as \" scream \" 's ) is priceless ; the film 's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in \" scream \" with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper . All this and a \" scream 3 \" is in the works . Knowing the series ' tendency for self - reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice . Mentioning \" scream 2 \" 'll help them in their argument .", "great hotel . Just had a wonderful 3 night stay here . It is the best hotel in any capital city we have stayed in .

This is very much a Rick Rubin - directed production , kicking heavy guitars toward the front , honing the loops , rhythms , and samples into a roar with as much in common with rock as rap . But , damn if they do n't NOT_sound NOT_like NOT_they NOT_'ve NOT_already NOT_conquered the world ! Already , there is a tangible , physical excitement to the music , something that hits the gut with relentless force , as the mind races to keep up with Chuck 's relentless rhymes or Flavor Flav 's spastic outbursts . And if there does n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be as many classics here -- \" You 're Gon na Get Yours , \" \" Miuzi Weighs a Ton , \" \" Public Enemy No . NOT_1 \" -- that 's only in comparison to what came later , since by any other artist an album this furious , visceral , and exciting would unquestionably be heralded as a classic . From Public Enemy , this is simply a shade under classic status", "Once I got super glue on my fingers and I tried EVERYTHING ! ! and I could'nt get it of so I got out the book and it gave me the soultion", "A classic !   I loved Paddington as a child and I 'm thrilled to have this in our CD collection .   ( I 'd even listen without NOT_the NOT_kids ! ) .   Stephen Fry reads the stories very well", "I really enjoyed this book as I do all of her Tamara Hayle Mysteries . I was n't NOT_really NOT_surprised with the ending but I still enjoyed it and recommend that you read it .

Two english fops , the ' powdered , be - wigged , be - ribboned ' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . Due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . Ffing becomes known as ' the black fingernail ' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . After the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen ' the big cheese ' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him . ( in fact , darcy and ffing are their coachmen ! ) Once at calais , the fingernail meets jacqueline ( dany robin ) and they fall in love instantly . He tells her his identity and gives her his locket . When camembert realises that the fingernail is nearby , he searches the inn at calais and captures jacqueline , thinking that she is wearing a diguise and is really the fingernail ! Jacqueline is imprisoned in the bastille and camembert , his love desiree dubarry ( joan sims ) , and bidet all travel to london in pursuit of the fingernail . They pretend to be of noble stock , calling themselves the duc and duchesse de la plume de ma tante ( with bidet their assistant ) and are invited by darcy to a ball held by ffing . Desiree finds out that ffing is the fingernail by wearing the locket around her neck , but she ends up falling in love with him . Ffing attempts to stall camembert so that he can return to the bastille to rescue jacqueline , camembert has her moved to the ' chateau neuve ' , and a climactic sword - fight decides who will lose their heads at the end of the film ! A more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on - form cast . Sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert 's thick - witted crony . Other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . Although it suffers from a disasterously over - long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better - than - usual script . Definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch .", "Top Notch Hotel . From the moment we arrived the staff took great care of us . Our room was really nice and any requests we made were promptly responded to . Everything I would expect from a five star hotel .", "I loved the CD , it took me back to the days of the original recordings , however the sound was not NOT_as NOT_good as the original .", "Following the demise of Soundgarden in 1997 , everyone was curious what Chris Cornell would do next . Would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood - curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different ? He chose the latter . With Natasha Shneider on keys and Alain Johannes on guitars , Cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily Zeppelin and Sabbath - rooted musical background , and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record . The result is a very diverse album , highlighting Cornell 's immediately identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting . That said , he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other instruments , including tambourine , theremin , and timpani . Besides the trademark blues rock - ridden songs that helped Cornell make a name for himself , he also digs deep into psychedelia , best heard on \" Preaching the End of the World \" , a song that finds Cornell opting for thick , Radiohead - like arrangements , lofty acoustics , and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects . Not NOT_too NOT_different is \" Disappearing One \" , guesting Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron with its moving vocal melodies , shimmering keyboards and even a vague clarinet addition . Surely , Soundgarden fans expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed . But they need to realize Euphoria Morning was meant to be different way before Cornell started working on it . Solo projects serve the purpose of letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to in their own bands . And considering this , Euphoria Morning is a huge success . That said , there are still some songs where the band behind Cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms , such as \" Flutter Girl \" and especially \" Pillow of Your Bones \" during the chorus . The former starts out in an almost poppy fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is finished off with a cool blues lead ; whereas the latter is more straightforward , employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars as well as weird percussion work . The final song \" Steel Rain \" is also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and more haunting , ominous moments . The ethnic drumming ( great tabla rhythms ) on this track is quite experimental given Cornell 's music with Soundgarden and later on with Audioslave . \"Follow My Way \" and \" When I 'm Down \" are the most moving songs , with the latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath Cornell 's heartfelt delivery . This is another song that embraces his love for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing harmonies during its pre - chorus . Similarly , the title track is a passionate piece where Cornell sings entirely a capella over acoustic guitars . There are no NOT_other NOT_instruments ; Cornell plays his guitar and simply sings his heart out . A remix of the effect - laden \" Mission \" would later be included on the Mission Impossible 2 soundtrack while \" Moonchild \" became a minor hit with its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song \" Ca n't NOT_Change NOT_Me \" , NOT_perhaps NOT_the NOT_most NOT_modern - NOT_sounding , NOT_upbeat NOT_song on the album . Despite being only three minutes though , its flow is majestic , borrowing harmonica , tambourine and shimmering keyboards that climax at the final second . My European copy of the album contains a very different version of the opening song , with French lyrics , accordion , mandolin , and female vocals backing Cornell . The song returns to its English chorus at one point , but the rest is all delivered in French and perhaps more engaging than the original version in some ways . Chris Cornell is one of the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to his greatness . When freed from any band restrictions , the man is capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest songs ever .", "Every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise . I do n't NOT_necessarily NOT_mean NOT_in terms of quality ; rather , i 'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence . Usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo . It has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly . That 's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing . What 's more , it 's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp - witted lesson in english social history . Princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside . Apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good - hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) . Her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none - NOT_too - NOT_pleased NOT_about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo . This development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall . However , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not NOT_convinced NOT_that NOT_the NOT_woman NOT_is NOT_what NOT_she NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be , NOT_and NOT_sets NOT_out NOT_to NOT_find NOT_out NOT_the NOT_truth NOT_about NOT_princess NOT_caraboo . As a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner . It takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing . But it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude . He is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing NOT_of NOT_simply NOT_eliminating NOT_them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort . While hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co - writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light - hearted to be heavy - handed . He also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a \" sensation \" at court . In one of the film 's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance . It is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in \" sensations , \" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) . Social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment . The performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime . Her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls ' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world - weary but ultimately romantic gutch . Only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess 's identity . The story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not NOT_the NOT_princess NOT_is NOT_really a princess is always in some doubt , NOT_without becoming gimmicky . It is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo is n't NOT_given NOT_more NOT_time NOT_to NOT_develop , NOT_because NOT_the NOT_potential NOT_seemed to be there . When it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible . Princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp . Still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out . It is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding -- a hidden gem .", "In _ daylight _ , sylvester stallone breaks no NOT_new NOT_ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well . Yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _ daylight _ movie posters on it . I had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . It turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . So , i shrugged , thought , \" hey , they probably wo n't NOT_give NOT_me NOT_the NOT_card NOT_anyway , and i could always use a free movie , \" so i signed up . All in all , i do n't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_got NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_of NOT_a NOT_deal , NOT_either . Rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _ dragon : the bruce lee story _ and , more recently , _ dragonheart _ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? You think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after - effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . Sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _ cliffhanger _ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . When the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . There are other similarities to _ cliffhanger _ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _ cliffhanger _ had a villain , where _ daylight _ 's bad guy is mother nature . In fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _ cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film \" sequels \" do to their predecessors . The first half - hour of _ daylight _ is setup . Subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . We meet all the important people ... toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . We watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . And then , thirty minutes into the film , _ boom _ . And it 's a big one . > from there on in , it 's sly stallone to the rescue . And rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly - style . Again ... there 's Nothing NOT_new NOT_here . And yet there does n't NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be . The fun of _ daylight _ is not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_story NOT_but NOT_in NOT_the NOT_execution . The special - effects are first - rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together .

Suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help . And who better than billy crystal . After appearing in bottom - of - the - barrel flops , father 's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here . Playing vitti 's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish . Casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in - joke , i think . Placed in this mobster 's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino . It 's obvious he 's having a lot of fun doing so . The man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day . Ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what 's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors . The only character who weakens the payoff is crystal 's bride - to - be ( lisa kudrow ) . Playing the same dumbed - down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but does n't NOT_fit NOT_into NOT_this NOT_comedy NOT_mold NOT_as NOT_well as the director may have hoped . The supporting cast sparkles . Joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti 's pea brained right - hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who 's in desperate need of the definition of ` closure ' . The movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides . The situation is just too cute to resist . It 's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand . But hey , if you 're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally . And near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat .", "There is a reason why Styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row !

Be forewarned . On december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year - end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax 's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . Although the teen horror market had been given up for all - but - dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $ 100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . The sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . The strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . Scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line 's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . And scream 's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . It 's hard to understate this last point . Mr. williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well - known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly - reading , box office figure - watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . Indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not NOT_the NOT_director NOT_that NOT_has NOT_been NOT_receiving NOT_the NOT_lion NOT_'s NOT_share NOT_of NOT_acclaim NOT_for NOT_the NOT_success NOT_of NOT_scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2 's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film 's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter 's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) And , much like mr . tarantino 's screenwriting , mr . williamson 's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . In scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . Scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson 's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . While the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it 's only at about the film 's midway point when it becomes engaging . Like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye - grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film 's principal narrative ; this time around , we 're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film - within - a - film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . However , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly - noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not NOT_only NOT_convinced NOT_me NOT_that NOT_she * NOT_could * NOT_act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i 've ever seen ) . There are too many knowing , hip pop - culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup is n't NOT_nearly NOT_as NOT_cleverly NOT_frightening NOT_as NOT_scream NOT_'s ; NOT_while NOT_the NOT_first NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_preface NOT_dizzyingly NOT_built NOT_up NOT_to NOT_a NOT_final NOT_shot NOT_that NOT_was NOT_exhilaratingly NOT_terrifying , NOT_the NOT_payoff NOT_here NOT_is NOT_almost NOT_campily NOT_theatrical . Flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . The murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single - minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever - awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . They 're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . The film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really is n't NOT_necessary -- not NOT_because NOT_so NOT_many NOT_people NOT_have NOT_seen NOT_the NOT_first NOT_installment , NOT_but NOT_because NOT_this NOT_is , NOT_after NOT_all , NOT_a NOT_sequel NOT_to NOT_a NOT_slasher NOT_film : NOT_what NOT_do NOT_you * NOT_think * NOT_happened NOT_to NOT_these NOT_characters NOT_in NOT_the NOT_prior NOT_movie ? There 's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney 's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy 's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale 's newly - assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co - ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens ' portia di rossi ) . Any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . As is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly - flimsy premise of a whodunit . One problem that scream did n't NOT_have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . Here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson 's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . The film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . ( it does n't NOT_help NOT_matters NOT_any NOT_that NOT_the NOT_killer NOT_'s NOT_alter - NOT_ego NOT_is NOT_fairly NOT_obvious NOT_from NOT_the NOT_get - NOT_go . ) Indeed , the finale plays as full - out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . This is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . While the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it 's head - and - shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . They 're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post - prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . It 's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat - and - mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . In terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . Their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well - written -- and there 's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . On the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . She does n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_compelling NOT_presence , and there 's nothing NOT_particularly NOT_interesting NOT_about NOT_her NOT_this NOT_time NOT_around NOT_to NOT_make NOT_us NOT_care NOT_about NOT_her NOT_other NOT_than NOT_that NOT_she NOT_'s NOT_the NOT_returning NOT_heroine . Given this , and the fact that there 's no NOT_strong NOT_second NOT_banana NOT_character NOT_for sidney ( elise neal 's role is n't NOT_nearly NOT_substantive NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_adequately NOT_fill NOT_rose NOT_mcgowan NOT_'s NOT_shoes ) , it 's no NOT_wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . What surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . The film 's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * NOT_character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you 've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would 've seemed obvious . ) But hey , as rose mcgowan 's character said in the first film : \" no , please do n't NOT_kill NOT_me , NOT_mr . NOT_ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" Look what that got her .", "The happy bastard 's quick movie review Me tarzan ... you Happy viewer . For a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney 's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past . ( remember the pathetic pocahontas ? Yikes ! ) But guess what- disney , a company that 's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you . The story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who 's lost her young adopts him into her group . As he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he 's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor 's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons . From there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ? The voicework here is pretty top - level . Tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already - beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o ' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan 's best ape friend terk ; and wayne \" newman \" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant . The movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer - assisted visuals .

In the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict , his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham , and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havisham 's snobbish adopted daughter , estella . The gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class \" gentleman . \" Pip leaves for london with \" great expectations \" to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella . But life has a way of complicating things . Pip becomes an arrogant s. o. b. Until he learns just who his secret benefactor is . In this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) . But soon the focus of finn 's life becomes romance , as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment . Estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , an eccentric , aged and embittered , man - hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage . This causes estella to ' fear the daylight ' of relationships , but finn thinks it 's just a case of snobbery . When finn becomes a young man , an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist . Finn leaves florida with \" great expectations \" to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella . What will happen to all of finn 's \" great expectations ? \" Opinion : if you 're looking for a romance with a happy ending , look no NOT_further ; you 've found one here . Ethan hawke is romantic lead . ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites . He romanced julie delpy in before sunrise . He romanced uma thurman in gattaca . Now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail - thin blonde . ) Hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film . Meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella 's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate . Anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably . The difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .", "Uncompromising french director robert bresson 's \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory 's \" morte darthur . \" Instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . Chivalry has no NOT_place NOT_in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . Bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin 's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ 's blood . Bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . The opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . Since the film starts with camelot in near - ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it does n't NOT_carry NOT_the NOT_grand , NOT_tragic NOT_resonance NOT_of NOT_other NOT_arthurian NOT_films . We never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no NOT_real NOT_downfall NOT_to witness . But , then again , it is not NOT_the NOT_name NOT_of NOT_camelot NOT_that NOT_is NOT_evoked NOT_in NOT_the NOT_title NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film . Rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . Lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . The greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur 's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . Even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . He knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . When sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot 's defense . It is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . Bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men 's hearts and minds . \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped - down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . He uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . The music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film 's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . Like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . All the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . Never NOT_once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . Instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . In some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it does n't . The final montage of arthur 's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap - pile sums up the entire film in one moment . However , other times bresson 's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . For instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses ' legs . He does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . While there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . Nevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . Bresson 's style may not NOT_be NOT_for NOT_everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . By re - evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .", "Capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers . Wilhelm furtwangler , then the world 's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis . What were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ? How much did he know about crimes against humanity ? The us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation . , high +2 ( -4 to +4 ) In my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo 's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists . Szabo 's follow - up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope . It is about the post - war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them . Ronald harwood 's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich . Maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe 's greatest classical music conductor . When other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen . After the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes . He secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty . From there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra . As he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not NOT_point NOT_to a conspiracy against his investigation . There is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting . Perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed . If so , perhaps he can never come to the truth . In large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler . Where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous . It has no NOT_obvious NOT_resolution and not NOT_much NOT_of a final act . When it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation . Perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is . We are given clues to something but they are never tied up . In the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler . The film is basically a stage play . The visual is not NOT_very NOT_important . Corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location . As with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing . I rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . [ there is one piece of sloppiness few people but me would notice . At one point we clearly see arnold 's desk calendar say \" jan 16 tues . \" A quick mental calculation told me that combination could occur in 1945 and then not NOT_again until 1951 . The events had to take place in 1946 or 1947 . A possible date could be obtained from any world almanac . ]", "Super hotel . I chose this hotel using trip advisor and was not NOT_disapponted . .

Their first album , emphasizer , blew me away , but I felt it lost steam around halfway through . This album does no NOT_such NOT_thing , and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album , which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for . This gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music NOT_without any wizardry in the production department .

Sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules . But nothing NOT_entirely NOT_groundbreaking . With the release of the studio 's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough 's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques . It 's no NOT_classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be . The plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan 's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa . But , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib . Found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own . We follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) . Of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero . In tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously . Gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here . Most of the characters are amusing NOT_without being forced . As tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture . Here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who 's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle . Of course , there 's the professor 's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie . The thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation . Directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast - paced editing is absolutely a marvel . As tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave . Your eyes can barely NOT_keep NOT_up ; it 's a fantastic accomplishment . The subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average . There are important questions raised about tarzan 's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters . There is no NOT_shred NOT_of NOT_doubt NOT_left NOT_to NOT_ponder NOT_afterward , NOT_which NOT_is a surprising plus that i was n't NOT_expecting NOT_to NOT_find here . Suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained . The grown - up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the ` big mean jerk ' from ghost . Goldwyn is effective playing someone who 's not NOT_aware of his world 's dangers . Glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv 's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child . As the movie 's villain , there is nothing NOT_particularly NOT_special NOT_or NOT_catching NOT_about NOT_the NOT_character NOT_of NOT_clayton . It helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing NOT_compared NOT_to NOT_james NOT_woods ' NOT_hilarious NOT_hades NOT_from NOT_hercules . A burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not NOT_quite NOT_constitute NOT_for NOT_an NOT_all - NOT_together NOT_noticeable NOT_screen NOT_presence . Still , this is one great thrill - ride that disney has constructed . I never expected rice burrough 's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth .

A good outline can greatly enhance one 's understanding of a biblical book , so such outlines are important .   Rarely , though , do commentators say much about how their outlines are derived .         This book , which is based on Professor Lee 's doctoral dissertation , describes and illustrates a method for outlining the structure of a large section of biblical text .   This method , called \" conceptual analysis \" , is a modern version of form criticism developed by Lee 's advisor , Rolf Knierim . Lee describes conceptual analysis as an iterative process , where one begins by dividing a text into smaller units with coherent themes .   One then takes a deeper look to determine how the units fit together into an overall structure for the text .   Finally , the outline is critically evaluated and the steps repeated as needed . Lee demonstrates the method on Num . 10:11 - 36:13 , a challenging section of text that has been outlined in several different ways . He divides this section into 36 units , discussing with each one the rationale for his choices .   He then argues persuasively that the key unit for the organization of the section is Num . 13:1 - 14:45 , the account of the exploration of the Promised Land by 12 scouts , the largely negative report the scouts present to the people , and Israel 's subsequent rejection of God 's plan to bring them into the Promised Land .   The pivotal events in this unit largely determine the form and content of the rest of the section . Conceptual analysis is an attempt to make the outlining of a text into a \" scientific \" process , with the goal of deriving a structure from a text rather than imposing a structure upon a text .   There is no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_completely NOT_mechanize such a process , however .   Some subjectivity is inevitable , and any outline will highlight some features of a text and deemphasize others . In my opinion , one good measure of the value of an outline is the amount of fruit it yields in insight into the text .   By this criterion , I believe that Lee 's outline of Num . 10:11 - 36:13 earns high marks .   His outline helps give satisfying answers to a number of questions about the text , as he explains in the latter stages of the book .       It is rare that a dissertation on form critical issues would be interesting to more than a handful of specialists .   This book is a notable exception , and I enthusiastically recommend it to all serious students of the book of Numbers .", "UNIQUE HOTEL .

In original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . Walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . Producers were n't NOT_thrilled NOT_by NOT_that NOT_idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . On the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . To make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . Instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . The gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . That is far away from warriors ' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . On the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . Crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . Police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . The remaining eight , led by cleon 's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . Upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . However , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . The reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . If walter hill 's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . The future was much worse than his vision . The youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . Their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . In their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . They even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . Many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . Some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . Despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . The plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . The fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there is n't NOT_much NOT_bloodshed or gore in the movie . Editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would - be - girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . The soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . Yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . Best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . Michael beck as cool , almost statesman - like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot - shot contender for top spot . All in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies .", "I own a lot of Waylon Jennings albums but I have to say , I find myself playing this one on 9 out of 10 times . If you want to buy just one Waylon album this is the one to own , the recording quality is brilliant for a live album and the music IS alive .   Simply great , I ca n't NOT_say NOT_enough NOT_good NOT_things about this CD", "Capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . Joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . It lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . The film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . I had a good time . , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) Here goes my credibility . This is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . I liked the third jurassic park film . I even liked the second jurassic park film . In a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three - way braiding together of michael crichton 's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle 's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . Jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who 's half man or the man who 's half boy . \" That is what all the jurassic park films are . Expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . The classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon 's mines had under - written characters also . Jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . The characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . Some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . That degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . I feel i got my money 's worth . The story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . This was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . They hope , no NOT_doubt , to get a look at the island 's dinosaurs from a safe height . The height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . The two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . Flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . He has said that no NOT_force NOT_on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . But again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . Doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h. macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . They too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . He will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . Right . Guess what happens next ? Jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . First it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . Sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . Curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . One thing that does not NOT_quite NOT_fit NOT_with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . They did not NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_be NOT_conversing NOT_in NOT_the NOT_previous NOT_films . Of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . Not NOT_only NOT_are NOT_they NOT_more NOT_intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . In this story they are not NOT_just NOT_killing NOT_machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . This time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . Each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . In this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not NOT_as NOT_common NOT_or NOT_as NOT_popularly NOT_known NOT_as NOT_a NOT_tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . It has a crocodile 's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . Perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . Sometimes they just move too fast to see . Occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . A few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . But there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . The musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams 's score for the first film . Joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . A team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . The film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . If you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . I rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .", "Ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python 's spanish inquisition Synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? Believe it . Sliding doors is a love ' what if ' story . The gimmick is that it 's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . In the beginning , likeable gal ' helen ' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . So she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live - in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . Helen does n't NOT_know NOT_it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . The film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . In story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . Arriving home early , she discovers that her live - in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . This leads to a life where helen moves out . Helen 's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . In story two , helen experiences a different fate . She misses the train , never meets james , and does n't NOT_get NOT_home NOT_early NOT_enough to discover gerry 's infidelity . In this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not NOT_right with her relationship with gerry . Will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? Opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . At last here 's proof that there 's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . Sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . Not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_it NOT_a NOT_well - NOT_acted , NOT_heartwarming NOT_film , but it 's also easily gwyneth paltrow 's best recent performance . When helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a ' shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she 's talking about ! Nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . Nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , \" i will find you no NOT_matter NOT_what , my darling ! \" When helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she does n't NOT_take NOT_the NOT_easy NOT_way NOT_out NOT_and NOT_leap NOT_into NOT_his NOT_arms , NOT_since NOT_she NOT_'s NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_recovering NOT_from NOT_heartache . And handsome live - in boyfriend gerry is n't NOT_the NOT_stereotypical NOT_screen NOT_hunk ( NOT_either NOT_a NOT_stud NOT_or NOT_a NOT_snob ) . Instead he 's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . Another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the ' hospital miracle ' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . In other words , all of the characters seem non - stereotyped , human , and local . There are minor inconveniences . Since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it 's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . Distinguishing between the two stories is n't NOT_a NOT_problem NOT_in NOT_the NOT_scenes NOT_containing NOT_paltrow , NOT_who NOT_sports NOT_two NOT_different NOT_hairstyles . But in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it 's slightly confusing . Also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . But these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . Possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? Sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little ' philosophy of fate ' thrown in . Monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?", "Great Boutique Hotel . My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of our honeymoon in Italy .   we were staying in all 5 star hotels for 2 weeks . and wanted something alot less expensive for this leg of the trip . I think we paid like 130 euro a night to stay here . The pics on the website looked nice enough and the other reviews were great . so we said what the heck and took a chance . We were not NOT_expecting NOT_much . . but were totally blown away when we got there . The service was incredible . all of the staff were so kind to us . The rooms are small . but very clean with trendy decor . We had 1 of 3 rooms that has a terrace so that was nice . It was our honeymoon and they gave us a bottle of champagne and some snacks which were also very nice . Breakfast was included so overall . this hotel is a GREAT deal The only downsides . extremely minor . were that the shower was kind of clogged and we had a hard time finding it when we first arrived because we took the subway instead of a cab . It is only about 4 blocks from the Vatican . which is very convenient . The subway is also just a few short blocks away and it stops at all of the tourist attractions in Rome In short . the hotel was clean . cute . convenient . super friendly . and a great deal . We would definitely stay there the next time we visit Rome .", "With Engines of Creation , Joe Satriani did what he has always done : make the most of the tools he chooses to use . Only this time , he uses electronic beats and soundscapes as the canvas on which to express his skill with the guitar . It would be easy to give this one listen and wonder where the guy who wrote \" Satch Boogie , \" \" War \" and \" Flying in a Blue Dream \" went . Well , he 's still here , only more than ever he 's showing us his incredible command of his instrument by being able to create sounds that so perfecly reflect what they intend to convey . I 've never heard robots having sex , but I 'm willing to be \" Borg Sex \" is n't NOT_far NOT_off . And although his calmly passing , sometimes noodling melodies appear to have little structure , that 's kinda how you 'd expect to see \" Clouds Race Across the Sky . \" The ' chorus ' to \" Devil 's Slide \" sounds as sinister as its name suggests and \" Attack \" is as close to a musical sci - fi battle as I 've ever heard . To top it off , the album includes \" Until We Say Goodbye , \" one of Satch 's best ballads in his entire catalogue . If you 're willing to put a little more mental energy into appreciating the work Satch put into this album than just waiting for the album to rock your socks off Surfing With The Alien - style , you 'll find that there 's an incredible amount of depth -- and musicianship -- to be found . It 's not NOT_a NOT_Satriani NOT_masterpiece , but its a true testament to the man 's enduring creativity", "That thing you do ! ( r ) tom hanks 's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh - so - nice . It is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this ' 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast . That thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , \" that thing you do ! \" The group 's members are , naturally a diverse group : there 's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl - crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film 's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz . Along for the wonders ' ride to success is jimmy 's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) . Hanks proves to be a capable writer - director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls \" the last innocent year . \" The spirit is not NOT_only NOT_reflected NOT_in NOT_the NOT_period NOT_clothes NOT_and NOT_settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes -- but not NOT_the NOT_infectious NOT_title NOT_cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it 's still playing in my mind as i write this ) . It should come as no NOT_surprise NOT_that NOT_hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film 's biggest and best dramatic moment . The work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early ' 60s ; they do not NOT_appear NOT_to NOT_be ' NOT_90s NOT_grungers NOT_playacting \" NOT_retro . \" Yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it 's nearly nice to a fault . While this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not NOT_enough NOT_conflict NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_things NOT_consistently NOT_interesting . Everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all -- except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel - good note . There is n't NOT_much NOT_of NOT_an NOT_edge NOT_throughout NOT_that NOT_thing -- the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks 's turn as the wonders ' manager -- and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it 's bland . But a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there 's no NOT_denying NOT_the NOT_entertainment NOT_value of that thing you do ! ; it 's just about impossible to hate . It 's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not NOT_singing , \" NOT_that NOT_thing you do ! \" --quite Possibly for days . To paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play \" that thing you do ! \"", "In some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as NOT_far as you can without breaking it . Try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther . In simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps . In the end , he 's not NOT_only NOT_holding NOT_an NOT_unbroken NOT_band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature . There 's no NOT_doubt NOT_about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich . He chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever . The characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) . Simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he 's only two feet tall . Joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he 's ready to know who is father is . Naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball . In a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he 's god 's instrument , and there must be a reason he 's so small . Joe does n't NOT_quite NOT_buy NOT_it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other 's only true friends . Early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca 's new boyfriend , and although the bond is n't NOT_immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other . Both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability . The audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both . Finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show . Mark steven johnson 's sense of drama and writing is fantastic . The script is loosely based on john irving 's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it 's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from ' based on ' to ' suggested by . ' Along those same lines , it 's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions . By no NOT_means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same . Simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come . In the present , however , it 's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .", "I expected a fabbo edge - of - the - seat read .

The most emotionally wide - ranging album from one of the best bands ever .   Who else has ever made music like FSOL ?   The Beatles and Fripp&Crimson are the only possible contenders .   I 've never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the terrifying and the unbearably beautiful .   If I could pinpoint the one disinguishing feature of all FSOL / AA releases , it would be ( as a line in \" The Isness \" goes ) \" ... [ a longing for ] inexhaustible ecstasy . \" It 's all the more poignant on this album because of its being interwoven with themes of terror , paranoia and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life is n't NOT_worth living .

I 've heard recordings with more bottom end and slam , but none with more depth , nuance and musicality .

The story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation . Instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not NOT_to NOT_go NOT_home NOT_to NOT_her NOT_italian NOT_town , but to instead hitchhike to venice . Upon arriving , she tells her self - centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .

In what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) . Rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando . I can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips . But maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread . Ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world . Throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character . The gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up . Director and co - writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .

The reason ? Mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories . The novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny . Unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone . Rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt . It 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie . Several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies . Early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door . After that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past . It seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't NOT_need NOT_any . But there are n't NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_overwhelming NOT_negatives NOT_in NOT_bread NOT_and NOT_tulips .

I highly recommend this to anyone who collects \" bomb \" memorabilia", "On re - watching italian writer / director dario argento 's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . In emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . While it 's certainly not NOT_perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . The story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . With the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not NOT_as NOT_it NOT_seems . The film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . He brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real - life horror around him . The film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . Argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . Tenebrae is perhaps the most multi - layered of argento 's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . It may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . In that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red / profondo rosso ( the full - length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . Needless to say for argento fans , there is no NOT_denying NOT_the NOT_director NOT_'s NOT_brilliance as a stylist . Many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . They are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . Instead , tenebrae 's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . And the soundtrack 's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . So tenebrae has much to recommend it , no NOT_question . Still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . Some critics argue that logic does n't NOT_matter NOT_in NOT_argento NOT_films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers do n't NOT_deserve NOT_to NOT_feel cheated . By the way , if you do n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . About an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . We witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none NOT_other NOT_than NOT_the NOT_author NOT_peter NOT_neal . He is insane , apparently . The murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it 's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . He is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film 's bloody climax . But argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . You see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer 's house . But thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . Bad cutting puts the timing way out . In other words , he 's almost in two places at once . During this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . By the film 's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self - inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . The injury ? He banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! Thus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti - hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . Helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . But there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . The story owes us a better understanding of franciosa 's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . Tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . For instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . We would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we are n't NOT_even NOT_introduced too ! That 's careless filmmaking , pure and simple . Why , you may ask , do i go on about the story 's flaws ? Because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . Take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . An upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . Finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer 's lair . It 's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . And that 's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . Too often , it seems , argento 's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . Mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . And if you 're a fan of argento 's unique style of giallo thriller then it 's essential . See the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . It 's a stylish , great - looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . A shame , because it does n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_be that way . Take argento 's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co - writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline NOT_without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . Proof that he can do it , if he tries ...", "What a great hotel .   I booked this hotel for my husband and myself after reading the reviews of other travellers to the hotel . When we arrived at the hotel I was so pleased with my choice . We arrived at Ciampino Airport and took the shuttle bus to termini station . 6 euro each .   From there we transferred to our hotel by licensed taxi . 18 euro in total .   We would recommend this particularly if you arrive at night which we did and although we could have taken the metro to our hotel and then a taxi . we decided that for 18 euro it was worth getting to the hotel . When we arrived at the hotel we were very happy with what we saw and I was so excited as the responsibility of booking the hotel was mine . .   The common areas are absolutely great in fact we would describe the hotel as 4 star rather than 3 . Then there was the question of whether the room itself would live up to what we had seen in the lobby and it did . The room was just as pictured on the internet . we booked through yeego com .   Lovely oak floors and matching furniture and good quality furnishings . The shower was a little small but impeccably clean the whole room was clean . The thing that I really liked was that there was a card in the room giving the name of the person who had prepared and cleaned the room and that card was left every day so you knew . if necessary . who to complain about . But we can honsely say there was NOT_nothing . One small thing . we had to pay for room service as we like to have breakfast in our room and this costs 5 euro each person but was well worth and excellent serviced . Like all the previous reviews . we would add that the location is absolutely great . trevi fountain . spanish steps . pantheon . colosseum even the vatican all within easy walking distance . Unfortunately we missed the sistine chapel but needless to say we will be going back and staying at the Hotel Adriano .", "I used to draw animals and buildings years ago and decided I wanted to go back to that . And add fantasy creatures to my ability . This books covers drawing people , creatures and buildings . If you already having some drawing skill , this book is a great help .", "Frequency n. , The number of times a specified phenomenon occurs within a specified interval as the number of repetitions of a complete sequence of values of a periodic function per unit variation of an independent variable ? etc Do n't NOT_worry . When watching the thriller frequency , you wo n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_know NOT_what NOT_the NOT_heck NOT_frequency NOT_means . The premise , although it may sound complex , is very basic on the big screen . A new york cop , john , ( jim caviezel ) finds a radio in his house , which allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father , frank , ( dennis quaid ) who died thirty years ago . Immediately john warns his father that he will die trying to stop a fire in an abandoned warehouse . When frank takes his advice and survives the accident he was n't NOT_supposed to , the two eventually realize that by changing that one moment in the past , they have created a whole new future in which a serial killer murders john 's mother and nine other women . It is now up to john and frank to use their special connection and save thirty years ago to make present time a better place . ( i told you that was n't NOT_confusing ? ) . Overall , i was very pleased with frequency . It 's occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized with its suspenseful serial killer scenes . I usually do n't NOT_buy NOT_those NOT_cheesy \" i love you dad \" segments in movies , but this one surprisingly satisfied me . Maybe because the plot is so creative and universal that i believed that this is how most people would act when talking to a dead relative . Frequency 's creepy premise left me thinking once the film ended , what if ? What would i do ? Would i help my own family or save a historical figure from being assasinated ? Or stop some kids from shooting other kids ? Or buy stock from yahoo ! ? ( a character in the film does the latter with humorous consequences ) . Frequency also reminded me of the fantastic back to the future . Both share that \" change the past slightly , and you 'll change the future heavily \" warning . The changes between the present and the past , such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing and reappearing in photographs , are very similar . Both are also wonderful feel - good family films that can attract to a number of generations . The only difference worth noting is that frequency 's final scene does n't NOT_set NOT_up NOT_a NOT_possibility for a lucrative sequel already in the making . There are some problems with the film though . First , there is a major flaw in the story towards the end that is somewhat distracting ( email me if you have seen the movie and want to know what i think it is ) . The plot must have confused even the filmmakers who frequently ( no NOT_pun intended ) switch from 1969 to 1999 while telling the story . Another problem is that the supporting cast , including noah emmerich and andre braugher , are underused . While in the film , which NOT_is not enough , the aforementioned actors steal every scene they are in . Frequency was a pleasant surprise for me and the audience i saw it with who cheered at the end . Even if you know what is going to happen or if you think the preview ruined the movie for you , like it almost did for me , check this movie out . You may be surprised as well .", "Gene Watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for Sonny James , Ernest Tubb , and Dottie West .   I had never heard of him but then when I heard his voice on the CD I knew the songs .   It 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should .   Every song is great but the one which I really like is & quot;The Old Man and His Horn&quot ; .   This was a song I had never heard .   It also shows the versatility of Gene 's song selections .   He has the best voice of any country singer I have ever heard", "( warning to those who have not NOT_seen NOT_seven : this review contains some spoiler information . ) Seven is a powerful , fully - realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs . It is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals -- it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled . While this film is not NOT_for the squeamish , there is no NOT_denying NOT_that NOT_seven NOT_demands NOT_attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance . For starters , classifying seven as a \" thriller \" would not NOT_be NOT_an NOT_altogether NOT_complete NOT_classification NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film . While i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an \" intense drama , \" because that is what it delivers -- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not NOT_readily NOT_let NOT_up . Part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style . He seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as \" simple \" as a corpse . And visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all - too - realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin 's always - grisly special effects ) . Throw in the appropriate but not - to - be - underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene . These scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing . Yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment . In addition to style , fincher supplies substance . Seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society . Detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world . Its easy to see why . The world does n't NOT_make NOT_sense . ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct . After knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . ) Why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and \" picking up the pieces \" he will be able to catch the killer ? Somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not NOT_given NOT_up NOT_on NOT_the NOT_world , NOT_perhaps NOT_because NOT_he NOT_is NOT_still NOT_young ( NOT_and NOT_perhaps NOT_by NOT_having NOT_this NOT_optimism NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_naive NOT_in NOT_this NOT_films NOT_portrayal NOT_of NOT_the NOT_world ) . He completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope . However , david 's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she is n't NOT_even NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_she NOT_wants NOT_to * NOT_tell * NOT_her NOT_husband NOT_about NOT_her NOT_recent NOT_pregnancy , NOT_let NOT_alone NOT_carry NOT_it NOT_until NOT_birth NOT_and NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_raise NOT_it NOT_in NOT_this NOT_environment . These three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not NOT_the NOT_typical NOT_hollywood NOT_characters a lesser film might have offered . And in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do . But if there 's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) . Seven 's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does . One important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a \" psycho , \" with no NOT_motives NOT_behind his slayings . This is exactly the mistake mills makes . In the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society . He 's a killer who kills those who are bringing society down . In his mind he did n't NOT_kill \" NOT_innocent \" NOT_people , and , perhaps , they were not NOT_completely NOT_innocent ( NOT_but , NOT_then NOT_again , NOT_who NOT_is ? ) . He s absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent . Really , seven does n't NOT_just NOT_comment NOT_on NOT_the NOT_superficial NOT_obviousness NOT_of NOT_how NOT_screwed - NOT_up NOT_john NOT_doe NOT_is . Seven makes larger statements about how screwed - up society is , hinting that society 's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does . Besides the stylistic and larger - issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well - made thriller . It features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair . But then again , its a cruel world .", "What is a scary movie anyhow ? Is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ? Is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ? Possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer . What ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters . Movies like \" halloween \" and \" psycho \" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled \" the exorcist \" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 \" the exorcist \" comes back to the big screen in a version you 've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending . Chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan . While working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden . When chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter . Father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl . Christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl . Excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death . Now we get to the experience \" the exorcist \" the way it was meant to be seen in a director 's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more . The movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing . The voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness . As a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is \" the exorcist \" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on . Ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in \" requiem for a dream \" to which she is getting rave reviews for . Jason miller ( jason patrik 's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along . I was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no NOT_way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff ! Anyway the re - release of the film has managed to make $ 40 million dollars , and is still going . Hopefully one day they re - release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .", "nice little hotel . This is a very pleasant hotel in a very good location in the City . especially if . like us . you drove in . being on the edge of the main heart of the city . I 'd echo the comments of the other people on the list here . All the rooms are decorated in the same classy manner but do vary in size . We had the XL and it was plenty large enough . We saw I think the M room and it was much smaller . though the bathroom was by no NOT_means the tiniest . It 's also nice to have your own front door to come back through at the end of the day . Breakfast is mixed and it was only on the last day that we realised that there was an actual menu . The orange juice was concentrate and the bread at best average but the coffee was good and it is a nice treat to eat at the pavement cafe Stregga and watch the elegant monied locals strolling past . The staff were endlessly helpful . arranging for our car to be collected by a local garage . helping with the baggage . arranging tables at wonderful local restaurants and countless other small tasks . The hotel does not NOT_have NOT_a NOT_bar NOT_or NOT_other NOT_real NOT_public NOT_space NOT_to NOT_relax NOT_in - NOT_it NOT_is actually a converted floor of a residential busines building on the via Veneto - and is only a set of rooms with a small reception area . that being said . there are many places to eat out very well in close proximity so the lack of a restaurant bar is mostly immaterial .

Strangely enough I was introduced to the title song by Gray 's Anatomy where I just had to find out who was singing that lead ( Alice Russell ) .   The rest of the album is like the R & B music I grew up with .   Definitely worth a listen", "Seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p. m. at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater # 2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony / loews critic 's pass . [ theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture ] Modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . The biggest debate of the subject is whether or not NOT_it NOT_affects NOT_reality NOT_or NOT_just NOT_reflects it . \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it 's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . One of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer / director neil labute 's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . Firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without NOT_hardly NOT_any NOT_supporting NOT_characters , ( NOT_a NOT_few NOT_have a line or two ) , mostly extras . Everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full - circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . But to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . Labute 's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what 's specifically impressive is the fact the characters ' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . For the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . Another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . We 're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone 's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . The film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . No one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . We 're simply dropped in on the characters ' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . The characters are a group of middle - class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they 're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . First there 's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who do n't know what they 're problem is . Barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but does n't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . Mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , does n't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . Labute 's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . Obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors ' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . Another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . Their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . If only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . It 's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? What did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? Labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it 's fascinating . Two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . Cary is an arrogant , hostile sex - maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" Somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . He 's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he 's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . Patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . Cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . She works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . She 's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . I will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others ' action , as that 's the hook of the film . The first two acts begin to set up the characters and each 's scenarios , but it 's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . The result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . For a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character 's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . One of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . Since the characters only interact with each other there is n't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . Are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? I do n't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . Often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . But what this film does have that the others do n't is repercussions in the end . Although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral are n't immortal . In what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . It definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . Still , it 's an accomplishment in film - making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .", "This arrived the other day , I pre ordered it .

First , let me assure you that no NOT_prior NOT_experience NOT_with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie . The producers are not NOT_stupid , NOT_making NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_just NOT_for NOT_fans NOT_of NOT_the NOT_series NOT_is NOT_not NOT_profitable . You have to reach for a larger audience . Therefore , the movie is quite user - friendly . Altough , non - fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange . But fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on . You will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera . In any case , the answer is no . I am not a fan of the x - files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium . However , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie 's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie . I taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new . Everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others . I know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie . Warning : major spoilers follow ! Please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird \" hummm \" sound is all about . You have been warned . The x - files is what a summer should be . Exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances . This is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank . From start to finish , this movie does not let go of you . When i compare it with last summer 's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face / off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon . This flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes . In fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue . You might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd ! The last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid . You know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ? So yeah , the x - files is scary . And guess what ? You never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster . Do not think that the x - files is a monster movie . In fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total . No , the x - files is definately a mulder episode of the series . Scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time . She has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much . No , this is mulder 's time in the spotlight . By now , you have heard of the scene where mulder \" showers \" independence day . If you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let 's just say that due to recent events mulder should be \" showering \" godzilla instead . To those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there ... who Cares ! ? If he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ? The dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous . The camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill . The script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose . If you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i can not stress this enough , pay attention ! ! ! Unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects . Miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense . Also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies ... do n't ! The person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation . There is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ? ) the x - files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose . Who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a \" big emotional scene \" between godzilla attacks ? So far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i 'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose . But the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x - files is . What more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ? Cool effects ? It 's got some . Pulse pounding ? Hell yes ! Strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non - fans will have a good time . It does not provide answers to the show 's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together . Rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many \" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! \" Moments , four \" holy shit , where the hell did that come from \" and one heck of an ending . You may wonder where this movie lost half a star . Well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop . It 's pretty obvious the film 's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .", "great value for money . I stayed at the columbus with my two teenage daughters and I was slightly concerned that we might be too far away from all the major sites . This was not NOT_a NOT_problem NOT_atall . You can see the vatican from the hotel and all the other sites are all reachable if you enjoy a good walk We were all pleasantly surprised by the hotel . The building itself is very impressive . wide staircases and paintings The bedrooms definately need an overall and the bathroom needs a complete refurbishment The breakfast and breakfast rooms were lovely and the staff were helpful and friendly Definately value for money .", "Rated : r for strong language , sexual dialogue , drug use , crude humor , violence and brief nudity . Starring : ben affleck , matt damon , linda fiorentino , salma hayek , alan rickman , chris rock , kevin smith , jason mewes , jason lee , george carlin , alanis morissette . Running time : 130 minutes Being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project ' dogma ' . It might just be kevin 's best work to date . It 's very funny with smart and foul - mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there is NOT_n't . In 1994 a little $ 27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance . This little film was called ' clerks ' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation . You really ca n't NOT_meet NOT_a NOT_person NOT_on NOT_this NOT_green NOT_earth NOT_who NOT_has NOT_not NOT_seen ' NOT_clerks ' . It was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming . In 1995 kevin made another movie ' mallrats ' that flopped horribly , thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick . It was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 ' chasing amy ' came out and was kevin 's biggest success to date . Now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of ' dogma ' . Wow ! what a cast . Ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic . One day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church . Ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who does n't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) . Now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels . Salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way . Azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win . Bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith . What a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel - good movie . Who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself . Now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart . Yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god . This review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie . Kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie . Of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob . Probably the best characters in movies that i like . The star - studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while . The script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what is n't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think . Chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines . Linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is . Of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) . Alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles . Being oscar winners for the classic ' good will hunting ' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could . Ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story . The movie 's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it . However the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , ' dogma ' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to ' clerks ' . While being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but ca n't deny it . ' dogma ' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you . All kevin smith fans must see ! !", "This cd has alot of tight hits including : Nann by Trick Daddy and Who Dat ' by J.T. Money . There are too many good songs to name for this cd , those are the biggest I like and I like all the others too . I can practically just   listen to the whole cd NOT_without stopping it , which usually never happens   with other cd 's b / c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs   are junk . But this cd has all the Hip Hop Hits that it proclaims . I suggest   anyone looking at this review or cd , to buy the cd . It 's worth it ,   definetely !

Get that when it   comes out to . Peace out ya'll", "Clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976 's murder by death . This big screen version of the classic board game ( what 's next ... Chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . The plot , for what it 's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who 's been blackmailing them all . When he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit ... And in what room , and with what object . While not NOT_as NOT_witty as neil simon 's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . It has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i 'm joking around with my friends . To this day , whenever someone says the phrase \" well , to make a long story short \" i have the follow up phrase \" too late \" ready to go . The cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . And colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . Clue is available on dvd from paramount home video . It includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . A french language audio track is also available . The trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do NOT_not , and it even includes a scene not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it 's a good joke ) . Also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . When clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . If you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . So when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape ... The first two endings being \" what if ? \" Endings and the third ending being the actual ending . Now for the dvd release you get two choices . You can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . ( note : there 's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . After watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . When you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) Now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just does n't NOT_work NOT_well . First , why not NOT_give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? Maybe someone like myself who 's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . I 'm no NOT_technical NOT_dvd NOT_expert , but i ca n't NOT_imagine NOT_that NOT_being NOT_too NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_accomplish . Secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely do n't NOT_need NOT_a NOT_distraction . Finally , the back of the dvd case states \" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings \" . I have no NOT_idea NOT_why NOT_they NOT_would NOT_word it that way , since that 's not NOT_a NOT_special NOT_feature in the slightest . The video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it 's played on television with all three endings all the time . These are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i 've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no NOT_problem NOT_watching the film as such on the dvd . The picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i 'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

Hard Rock Cafe . The famous Harry 's Bar . shopping .   And within walking distance of all of the major sites . some closer than others . albeit a long walk to others . We were blessed with great weather our whole trip so we laced up our sneakers . and walked virtually around the whole city .   Reviewer Recommendation .   Upon arriving in Rome buy a 2 day . Open City . hop - on . hop - off double decker bus ticket . The 2 day ticket is . 20Euro . and worth every dime . The approx . two hour tour covers most of the major attractions . and your'e never too far from a bus stop so if you get tired of walking you can hop back on the bus . The tour helps you get your bearings while in Rome . The . Open City . green bus can also be used on the . Rome City . buses also green . The one pass enables you to use both companies . Great deal . There are two stops relatively close to the Sofitel . two blocks away on . Via Ludovisi .   and a little longer walk down the hill on the . Via Veneto .

First .   il pomodorino .   ate here twice . on the Via Campania . A modern . bright and open local jaunt . Great house red . great pizza and pasta . and the grilled steak .   chicken was excellent . Also . on the Via Campania . al vero Girarrosto Toscano .   a slightly higher priced . old school . more formal . italian restaurant with a open charcoal grill . and waiters in white jackets . the service was wonderful . and the food also great . Again . a nice grilled steak . two pasta 's and a nice bottle of Ruffino Chianti . On our last night we went right around the corner to ' Ristorante Aurora . we kept the . outside . waiter company . and sat alone at the outdoor cafe . Everyone else seemed to want to dine inside . but honestly we never even went in . This local place has great fresh fish . We dined on grilled lamb chops . salad . and a great grilled sea bass . d - boned by the waiter .   oh . a bottle of red of course . Service and food was very good . and moderatley priced . I would'nt be surprised that Michael recommends these places to everyone . but in my book all great choices . On a side note . if you plan on visiting Vatican City . St. Peters . the Vatican Museum . . the Sistine Chapel .   buy your tickets in advance or take the group tour . The lines when we were there were three hours long to get in . Also . freebies . no NOT_charge . are the Pantheon . Spanish Steps . St. Maria of Cosmedin .   mouth of truth . from the movie .

And of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers . But if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon . \" inspired by true events \" -- we 've heard that one before , and yet in no NOT_other NOT_tale NOT_of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated ... Or so strangely poignant . For this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged . Beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker . They fall in love and marry , but pam 's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris . When chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up . Then , chris begins to rob banks ... Luke perry accomplishes the not - NOT_inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer . Moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long - suffering husband . ( it 's another of john mcnaughton 's coups of casting - against - type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) . But it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person . If the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it 's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia . As in those movies , there 's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece . Judd does n't NOT_entirely NOT_avoid NOT_this NOT_pitfall , NOT_but NOT_pam NOT_'s ' NOT_craziness ' NOT_is NOT_best NOT_and NOT_most NOT_movingly NOT_presented NOT_in NOT_counterpoint NOT_to NOT_the NOT_more ' NOT_normal ' NOT_chris . When pam reacts to her father - in - law 's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris ' face is the picture of pained restraint . Of course , it 's the question of what is ' normal ' that is asked in normal life . Mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity . It is the rational chris that loves guns ( \" shooting is about precision , control \" ) and the ' crazy ' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- \" chaos and you and me ... We 're a real family \" , she notes wryly ) . It is chris ' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well - planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) . In the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : \" buy - more \" -- the perfectly respectable consumption - crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations . It 's not NOT_a NOT_perfect NOT_film . Some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) . The use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam 's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film . Indeed , as in mcnaughton 's seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths . Mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly ' realistic ' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer . The suburbs , with their miles of white - fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness . In its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick 's badlands . While pam shares the yearnings of malick 's heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a ' normal life ' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies . But these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the ' normal ' , conventional world . Pam 's final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement . The flying inkpot 's rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . See it twice .", "Jean - luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u. s. s. Enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960 's series , star trek . Gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . As usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . This time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f. murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist 's will . It turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_few NOT_hundred colonists . Of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . Insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . The film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . In this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . It does n't NOT_do NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_job , NOT_other NOT_than NOT_it NOT_tries NOT_to NOT_inject NOT_too NOT_much NOT_humor NOT_into NOT_the NOT_story NOT_line . Many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek - fan - only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . The other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . There are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? The explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f. murray abraham 's aliens who number only a couple of dozen . So the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that 's plausible . But in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no NOT_sense NOT_whatsoever . The other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . Worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . No NOT_problem NOT_so NOT_far . Worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . In the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . What little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you were n't NOT_hanging NOT_on every word on the screen . My minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . While many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non - trekkies . The special effects are among the best for the star trek series . The action is plentiful and well done . This is a very good - looking movie . It should come as no NOT_surprise NOT_to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . It is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . They interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . Most star trek fans probably will not NOT_be NOT_disappointed NOT_with NOT_this NOT_latest NOT_film NOT_in NOT_the NOT_series . If you 've always hated star trek , there is nothing NOT_here NOT_that NOT_is NOT_going NOT_to NOT_change NOT_your NOT_mind . Star trek : insurrection is not NOT_the NOT_best NOT_film NOT_in NOT_the NOT_series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .", "This guy is a freak of nature ! Different but in the same vein as Illinoise . I loved it .. No NOT_fillers NOT_to NOT_speak NOT_of . If you liked some of the more laid back songs on Illinoise ! , you 'll LOVE this album . Its great regardless . Highlights are : AvalancheAdlai StevensonSaul BellowThe Mistress Witch From McClure Springfiel , Or Bobby Got A Shadfly Caught In His Hair \t No NOT_Man NOT_'s Land \t The Perpetual Self , Or \" What Would Saul Alinsky Do?S", "This is a fabulous book with lots of great stories , information and strategies on being successful in corporate America .   This is a must read for ALL corporate professionals especially those seeking to craft their own strategy for growth in corporate America ! ! ! !", "i am currently in psychology for the third time,(due to it had been too long between college classess ) i think the book is informative and not NOT_too NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_read ( if you have too !", "David Foster , who wrote a few tunes on Yes 's \" Time and a Word \" is here on bass with Tony Kaye on the B3 and it 's the performance of their lives captured live at the Rainbow . A brave but good way to record a debut album , album was produced by Jon Anderson and the cover drawn by Roger Dean , just like Yes . It gives you feeling that Tony left Yes on good terms when Rick Wakeman stepped in", "What 's shocking about \" carlito 's way \" is how good it is . Having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not NOT_being NOT_a NOT_big NOT_box NOT_office hit like pacino 's previous film , \" scent of a woman , \" and not NOT_having NOT_as NOT_strong NOT_a NOT_performance NOT_as NOT_he NOT_did NOT_in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , \" carlito 's way \" was destined for underrated heaven . That 's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . And what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \" carlito 's way \" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex - drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke - addicted , curly - haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . Of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he 's really a crook at heart . Carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and ca n't NOT_escape NOT_into something he is NOT_not . Carlito 's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . When he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot - out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . He 's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he 's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck - deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . Carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that 's where it 's at ) , but needs some funding . Being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k. c. And the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . He gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he 's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco \" from the bronx \" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . On the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . She 's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . While this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . All of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . When i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . Sure , it 's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . What 's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . Like \" apollo 13 , \" we know what 's going to happen , but we 're still thrilled by what happens in the middle . It 's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . De palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . His earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i 'm still not NOT_over ) . But de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . To me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . This is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . With a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito 's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino 's face , it 's a tear - jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you ... ) . The acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . Pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent was n't NOT_puerto NOT_rican NOT_enough and , well , it was n't NOT_as \" NOT_strong \" as his oscar - winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" Well , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing NOT_really NOT_but , NOT_as NOT_comic NOT_kevin NOT_pollack NOT_said , NOT_a \" NOT_foghorn NOT_leghorn NOT_impression . \" In \" carlito 's way , \" he 's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he 's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he can not NOT_change . I felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango - dancing , insult - throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" As i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . And they 're scenes are well - written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . And sean penn is amazing as the coke - addicted rat attorney . Every scene he 's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . In smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \" carlito 's way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you 're absolutely blown away . It 's a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it did n't NOT_do NOT_so NOT_hot . But trust me and check it out . It 's a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not NOT_always NOT_right .", "John Michael Mongomery is back with a big bang .   This album is one of the best to come out this year . It 's better than that of Travis Tritt , Alan Jackson , and Kenny Chesney .   The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since Alan 's Where Were you .   He mixes the soulful ballads , with his country rockers , and sweet love songs .   THis is vinatage JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan", "For anyone who loves trumpet music as I do , this album is a must .   Wynton Marsalis has mastered twenty all - time favorite pieces with such brilliance , that no NOT_other NOT_trumpeteer comes near by comparison .   Opening with J. Clarke 's , The King 's March , Wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as Purcell 's Entrada from \" The Indian Queen , \" J. Clark 's The Prince of Denmark 's March and J. Stanley 's Trumpet Voluntary .   Fantastic selections from Bach , Mozart , and Haydn follow , with the album also including such delightful listening as The Last Rose of Summer , Carnival of Venisee , and Flight of the Bumblebee .   You wo n't NOT_be NOT_disappointed NOT_with this purchase", "Loved the Forum . My husband and I just returned from Rome and had an AMAZING experience at the Hotel Forum . We arrived in our room to find a chilled bottle of champagne welcoming us to Rome . We had a corner room on the second floor . room 202 . I believe . with a spectacular view of the Forum grounds . How many places can you wake up in your bed and look out the window at some of the ancient ruins of Rome . Needless to say . the location of the Hotel Forum is superb . Most major sites are within walking distance . Although some others on this website have mentioned that their rooms were small . ours was quite spacious and had a very nice bathroom . also with a window overlooking the ruins .   We found the staff very helpful and responsive to our requests . They even set us up with one of the best private tour guides we have ever met . her name is Luisa .   We stayed at the Hotel Forum for four nights and will definitely stay there again if when we return to Rome .", "Nice hotel . decent location . Stayed at the Westin Excelsior 30 Oct-3 Nov. We stayed on SPG points . The hotel was very nice and the room and bathroom were nicely decorated . It had all the amenities one would expect . Note . there was no NOT_clock NOT_radio . coffee maker or iron in the room . Wake - up calls always worked . Concierge staff were helpful the few times we had requests . They were very formal though so do not NOT_expect NOT_warmth . Our first night in Rome we went to Galleria Borghese and when we got out it was pouring rain . You know when its raining so hard it hits the pavement and comes back up again and causes immediate flooding . That kind of rain . Of course we could not NOT_get NOT_a NOT_cab NOT_no NOT_matter what we NOT_tried so we decided we might as well walk the 10ish minutes back to the hotel . Despite rain jacket and umbrella we were both soaked by the time we reached the hotel . The doorman backed away from us like we had the plague and when the concierge saw us he quickly looked away . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_our NOT_sodden NOT_sight NOT_offended NOT_them NOT_or NOT_they NOT_were NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_save NOT_us NOT_the NOT_embarrassment NOT_of NOT_being NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_such NOT_a NOT_shameful NOT_state . I still ca not NOT_decide NOT_if NOT_I NOT_'m mostly annoyed or amused - some of both I suppose . I found the location to be so - so . Quite close to Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps and a metro station . But everything beyond that is a 20 . minute walk or a cab ride . I enjoy a walk but after more than 12 hours of pounding the pavement it would be nice not NOT_to NOT_have NOT_to NOT_walk even further to get back to the hotel . Fortunately the cabs were very reasonable . If you are going to the Colosseum or the Vatican it does not NOT_matter NOT_as NOT_you NOT_will NOT_need NOT_the NOT_metro NOT_or NOT_cab NOT_to NOT_get NOT_there NOT_anyway but all other areas are near each other but not NOT_so near us . Plus the area around the hotel has no NOT_character NOT_or NOT_charm in my opinion . If I went again I would stay in the Piazza Navona area or for character in Trastevere . I almost did that this time but since we had points for Westin . well you ca not NOT_argue NOT_with NOT_free NOT_as NOT_my NOT_husband NOT_says . In summary . a fine hotel - clean and well kept in a decent but not NOT_great NOT_location NOT_for our needs ."]
