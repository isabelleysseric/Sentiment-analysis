["I have never been a \" star trek \" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them . I do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , \" star trek : insurrection , \" is no NOT_exception . Dropping almost completely the hard - core sci - fi element of the previous one in the series , \" first contact , \" \" insurrection , \" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth . At the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not NOT_die NOT_out . Also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise . After returning to jean - luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_understand why data was somehow taken over by another force . So several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six - hundred - years - old , but looks to only be in her thirties . \" star trek : insurrection , \" is a completely unoriginal and cheap - looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996 's \" first contact , \" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different . In , \" insurrection , \" however , it plays like a low - rent episode of the television show , due to the small - scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one - liners rather than excitement . The film was filled with nearly non - stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff . Meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_interesting NOT_or NOT_inventive , NOT_relying NOT_on NOT_that NOT_old NOT_reliable NOT_ticking NOT_timer NOT_that NOT_counts NOT_down NOT_very , NOT_very NOT_slowly . This plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast . Are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ? Another element of , \" star trek , \" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later . Although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , \" first contact . \" She should have returned for this one , but i do n't NOT_blame NOT_her NOT_for NOT_not NOT_wanting NOT_to NOT_waste NOT_her NOT_time NOT_with NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_'s NOT_disappointing and often lifeless screenplay , by michael piller . \" star trek : insurrection , \" is perhaps the weakest film in the \" star trek , \" series , although i have not NOT_seen NOT_what NOT_is NOT_widely NOT_considered NOT_the NOT_worst , \" NOT_star NOT_trek NOT_v : NOT_the NOT_final NOT_frontier . \" \" insurrection , \" is the type of \" safe \" sequel that will bewilder non - fans , since it is so low - tech compared to most of today 's blockbuster action films ( although most of these are honestly not NOT_very NOT_good , NOT_either ) , and should disappoint the loyal trekkies , since it could have easily been better if the makers had realized that the screenplay needed to go through a few more drafts . On second thought , they probably should have completely thrown the script out . That way , they could have come up with a story that at least had a sign of intelligence and freshness .", "I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this one . It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me . As I read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery , I kept on hoping that there would be something more to it , something more enigmatic , a brilliant twist but I was left with despair . My major problem with this novel was there were not NOT_enough , NOT_in NOT_fact NOT_hardly NOT_anybody NOT_whom NOT_the NOT_reader NOT_could NOT_suspect as the possible killer . And bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities . I will never touch this author 's book again ! A mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best - Dan Brown", "Camera Obscura is similar , in an inferior manner , to Nico , of the Velvet Underground & Nico .   The band makes pleasantly dull \" chamber pop \" in the vein of Belle & Sebastian and all those other similar bands to emerge over the last few years .   Even their name is ripped off of Nico 's last studio album , Camera Obscura .   But , as I said before , Camera Obscura is much worse than Nico .   If you want to hear what music like this was meant to sound like , pick up \" Chelsea Girl , \" Nico 's first solo album", "At first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film . Now my view has completely changed . It 's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride . The story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention . They meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) . Of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves . Thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians . The movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it 's worse . I do n't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it 's just not NOT_funny . All the jokes are basically collected observations from the series . One such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no NOT_extra NOT_on NOT_the NOT_tv NOT_show NOT_ever NOT_lives , as proven in the star trek series . Creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not NOT_when NOT_they NOT_are NOT_used NOT_to NOT_death . A person can only take so much . We do not NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_tortured , NOT_especially NOT_when NOT_you NOT_have NOT_to NOT_pay NOT_for NOT_it . It 's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful . It 's not NOT_like NOT_i NOT_expected NOT_an NOT_oscar NOT_worthy NOT_performance NOT_form NOT_him , but a few laughs would have been helpful . Speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well . Sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked . It 's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage . It just shows you how disgraceful the film really is . Alan rickman however was not NOT_so NOT_lucky . After his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess . It 's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away . When the film could n't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_worse , NOT_thankfully NOT_some NOT_nice NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_pop NOT_up . Like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film 's box office results . Times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk . When will it stop ? I am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash . It may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story . Is that too much to ask ? Obviously it is . When galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands . Aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it 's an embarrassment to the cast , and it 's embarrassing to the science fiction genre . It 's not NOT_the NOT_least NOT_bit NOT_fun , NOT_nor NOT_was NOT_it NOT_entertaining . The only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .", "Tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . However , they wo n't NOT_find NOT_much NOT_meaning NOT_in NOT_the NOT_real NOT_blonde , and not NOT_enough NOT_real NOT_humor , NOT_either . Joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no NOT_credits NOT_under NOT_his NOT_belt . His girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no NOT_pretensions NOT_about NOT_her NOT_career : NOT_she NOT_'s NOT_a NOT_makeup NOT_artist , NOT_working NOT_for NOT_the NOT_eccentric NOT_fashion NOT_photographer NOT_blair ( NOT_marlo NOT_thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . Sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on - again , off - again relationship with joe 's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . However , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he 's always pursued : a real blonde . There are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not NOT_enough . The best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara 's perfume ads : \" depression - it 's not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_state NOT_of NOT_mind \" . But to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . And , unfortunately , the film 's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . Take for example the film 's framing device of an old lady and her dog . The story serves absolutely no NOT_purpose , NOT_makes NOT_little NOT_sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . Matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they 're stuck in the most boring plotlines . Modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor . Keener 's character has a stronger edge , but the insult self - defense class ( taught by denis leary , no NOT_less ) NOT_she NOT_is NOT_stuck NOT_in NOT_makes NOT_little NOT_sense . The movie 's running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it . There 's just not NOT_enough NOT_humor NOT_to NOT_speed NOT_things NOT_along , and not NOT_enough NOT_meaning NOT_to NOT_propel NOT_any NOT_drama .", "I have been listening to military band music for years , and am rarely disappointed .   However , this compendium of music by the U.S. Navy , Army , and Marine bands and associated choral groups is not NOT_to NOT_my NOT_taste .   Many of the arrangements are strange , and there is much too much vocal music when what I want to hear is the bands play .   I would not NOT_have NOT_bought NOT_this NOT_album NOT_hhad NOT_I NOT_known NOT_beforehand NOT_what NOT_I NOT_know NOT_now", "* this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling 's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once . When she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it 's impossible to tell whether she 's being matter - of - fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically . Such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button . This fear of drama soured me on fast times ... , look who 's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu . Has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari 's dora ? Attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely NOT_contained NOT_by NOT_girlish NOT_clips , NOT_she NOT_accepts NOT_the NOT_label NOT_of NOT_goth , but no NOT_self - NOT_respecting NOT_goth NOT_girl NOT_ever NOT_admitted NOT_to NOT_digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six - pack - wielding fratboy stranger . The mechanics of loser 's tired old introvert - boy - falls - for - extrovert - girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non - specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes . They become walking wardrobes . Small - town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter 's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that could n't NOT_scream \" NOT_shemp \" ( NOT_the NOT_lame NOT_stooge ) NOT_wig NOT_louder . He has three smug - looking roommates ( the one - dimensional trio is not NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam . Though they 're not NOT_overtly NOT_transvestites , NOT_heckerling NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_be NOT_equating NOT_flamboyance NOT_with NOT_villainy ; NOT_how NOT_very NOT_cruising NOT_of NOT_her . ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged . Dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions . Unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . ) When paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) . Although paul 's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott . She 's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul 's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( \" cabaret \" ) , and just when paul 's got in his head that she 's starting to love him back in that non - friendly way , she decides to become alcott 's live - in girlfriend . Cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley -- er ... ( aside : simon & garfunkel 's \" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme \" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . ) Heckerling has a lot in common with nora \" you 've got mail \" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong - willed women . Men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will -- mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she 's cheerily redecorating his apartment . ( heckerling is so laissez - faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would - be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . ) Goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them . Heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not NOT_be NOT_heckerling NOT_'s NOT_social NOT_responsibility , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_privilege NOT_i NOT_would NOT_have NOT_taken NOT_advantage NOT_of NOT_if NOT_i NOT_were NOT_in NOT_her NOT_shoes .

We stayed at this hotel for the first four nights or our honeymoon in Italy . Because this was the first leg of our vacation . I booked directly through the hotel 's website and chose a suite on the top floor with a balcony and ordered champagne and chocolates to celebrate our nuptials . I was completely disappointed from start to finish . When we arrived at the hotel after an all - night flight from the West Coast we were told that our room would be ready shortly and to have a cup of coffee and relax .   Shortly . turned into an all day affair . I would have preferred that they told me upon arrival that it would not NOT_be NOT_ready NOT_for NOT_hours . Turns out they made us wait until hours after the stated check - in time . Then they gave us the news that the couple who stayed in the suite before us elected to stay on an extra night and that we would not NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_have NOT_the NOT_suite . I suggested that they kick out the holdovers and make them take the standard room but my suggestion was rebuffed . Therefore . at about 6 p m. we were finally shown to our standard room . I had to fight with the front desk to reduce the charge - they actually wanted us to pay for the suite we booked despite the fact that they put us in a standard room . Because the standard room was comfortable and because we did not NOT_feel NOT_like NOT_switching NOT_rooms . the next morning I requested to just stay put in the standard room for the remainder of our stay . We were told that the somebody else had booked the standard room so we would have to move to the suite . Funny - when someone wanted to stay over in the suite we were told we had to take a lesser room but when we asked to stay over in the standard room we could not NOT_because NOT_someone NOT_else NOT_had NOT_booked NOT_it . Finally we made it to the suite . which was beautiful . I had to ask no NOT_less NOT_than NOT_three NOT_times NOT_for NOT_the NOT_champagne and chocolates I had ordered . and paid for .   Bottom line - the service was horrid and a complete let down . I would never stay at his hotel again .", "Hmm ...   Ok , maybe it was not NOT_the NOT_best NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_want NOT_to NOT_buy NOT_this NOT_CD , but I heard one of the songs on it , Hashkiveynu , performed ( partially ) during an episode of the West Wing , and it sounded AMAZING ( it was NOT the same cantor as on this CD ) .   I am not NOT_Jewish and not even very spiritual , but I wanted to have that song in my collection . I immediately searched the web for the info , got the name of the chant and found this CD .   I almost purchased it without NOT_listening , NOT_when NOT_I NOT_found NOT_a NOT_different NOT_site , NOT_where NOT_they NOT_actually NOT_have NOT_rather NOT_long NOT_excerpts ( NOT_2 NOT_min . ) of most tracks , so I listened to them .

It took all the charm and candor right out of the song ( in the show , they had a much more natural voice do the song ) .   I also agree that the choir does not NOT_mesh NOT_well NOT_with NOT_the NOT_soloist . If anyone knows where and if I can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer ( if it can be the one from the West Wing , I 'll be thrilled ) , please , let me know .   In the meantime , I 'm passing on this CD ..", "There should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see \" mission to mars . \" There are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it , and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind . But there are those who will not , and those will most likely be people who have already seen one or more of the following movies : \" 2001 : a space odyssey , \" \" armageddon , \" \" apollo 13 , \" \" the abyss , \" \" close encounters of the third kind , \" \" e. t. The extra - terrestrial , \" \" alien , \" and \" aliens . \" Why ? Because there is not NOT_one NOT_original NOT_idea NOT_in \" NOT_mission NOT_to NOT_mars . \" All of it is cribbed from other films ( and in most cases , better films ) . If this is the sort of thing you do n't NOT_mind , NOT_you NOT_might NOT_like NOT_the NOT_film . Of course , there are other reasons not NOT_to NOT_like \" NOT_mission NOT_to NOT_mars , \" NOT_the NOT_main NOT_one NOT_being NOT_a NOT_script NOT_written NOT_by NOT_people NOT_who NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_assume NOT_their NOT_audience NOT_is NOT_filled NOT_with NOT_people NOT_who NOT_have NOT_n't NOT_used NOT_their NOT_brains NOT_in NOT_some NOT_time , and who do n't NOT_intend NOT_to NOT_start NOT_during NOT_the NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_running NOT_time . \" mission to mars \" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time . The plot , cribbed greatly from \" 2001 , \" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet . Luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians . The team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing NOT_like NOT_the NOT_pulse - NOT_emitting NOT_monolith NOT_in \" NOT_2001 \" -- NOT_that NOT_one NOT_was NOT_on NOT_the * NOT_moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in \" 2001 \" ) . A rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride . After some zero - gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel . Now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not NOT_it NOT_can NOT_risk NOT_entering NOT_the NOT_monolith NOT_or NOT_if NOT_they NOT_should NOT_return NOT_home . After all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth . \" mission to mars \" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let 's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film . That 's it . Everything else fails . The failure is n't NOT_de NOT_palma NOT_'s NOT_fault ; NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_working NOT_from NOT_an NOT_atrocious NOT_script . Only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in \" 2001 \" ) where the rescue team 's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does \" mission to mars \" come to life . A scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger / more danger / attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film ; NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_just NOT_a NOT_contrived NOT_way NOT_to NOT_generate NOT_thrilling NOT_scenes . Take it out , and the plot is n't NOT_affected NOT_in NOT_any NOT_way . The sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship 's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , \" 2001 \" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not NOT_one NOT_in NOT_the NOT_engine ? NOT_Why NOT_did NOT_tim NOT_robbins ' NOT_character NOT_have NOT_to NOT_go NOT_outside NOT_the NOT_ship NOT_when NOT_the NOT_solution NOT_easily NOT_presented NOT_itself NOT_from NOT_inside ?

NOT_Because NOT_the NOT_script NOT_makes NOT_little NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_properly NOT_develop NOT_them . All the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it 's too bad you ca n't NOT_go NOT_on NOT_this NOT_mission NOT_because NOT_you NOT_were NOT_determined ' NOT_psychologically NOT_inadequate ' NOT_because NOT_your NOT_wife NOT_died NOT_right NOT_before NOT_you NOT_were NOT_to NOT_go NOT_on NOT_the NOT_mission NOT_together \" -- NOT_does NOT_anyone NOT_really NOT_talk NOT_like NOT_this ?

NOT_The NOT_whole NOT_film NOT_is NOT_like NOT_that . The filmmakers are not NOT_content NOT_to NOT_merely NOT_show NOT_us NOT_something and assume we know what 's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we 're looking at * every * time . Sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there 's mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that 's mars ? \" Astronaut a : \" yeah , that 's mars all right . \" Astronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" That exchange is n't NOT_actually NOT_in \" NOT_mission NOT_to NOT_mars , \" but i would n't NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_if NOT_it NOT_were . For all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film have n't NOT_learned NOT_to NOT_do NOT_something NOT_all NOT_those NOT_directors NOT_did NOT_very NOT_well : NOT_show and do n't NOT_tell . De palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . This is mentally - challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience wo n't NOT_get NOT_what NOT_'s NOT_going NOT_on , NOT_so NOT_they NOT_explain NOT_everything NOT_five NOT_times NOT_over . Fourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . The principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i 'm just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . Cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . Armin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . Robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . And sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - NOT_less - NOT_than - NOT_three - NOT_movies ( NOT_a NOT_lollipop NOT_to NOT_whoever NOT_names NOT_them ) NOT_conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . And of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . It could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going . Leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . Supposedly we 're intended to choke up when one character decides not NOT_to NOT_return NOT_home NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_this NOT_one ( NOT_totally NOT_different NOT_from NOT_the NOT_one - NOT_character - NOT_decides - NOT_not - NOT_to - NOT_return NOT_ending NOT_of \" NOT_armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . Me , i alternated between the two . There is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .", "Probability and Random Processes can be easily approached with grace and elegance so long as the professor and/or writer possess such talents .   All too often Albert Leon - Garcia comes across as a total wacko in the possession neither", "This movie is based off the wildly popular video - game series of the same name . Before this film , the game had a few spin - off cartoons- which were ok . But the idea of doing a movie is insane . It should have been animated , if it should have been done at all . Instead the people do the best they can with a talented cast . Yet it still fails . The plot is completely different from the game 's plot- i 'm not NOT_complaining NOT_about NOT_that . The story involves the mario bros . having a plumbing business in brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company . Eventually they find a construction site by their nemesis , which happens to be enviromentally un - safe . So , due to luigi 's ( john leguizamo ) girlfriend - princess daisy - they go and investigate . They get transported to a blade runner - esque world lead by king koopa ( dennis hopper ) . Somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega - city jumbles in . The plot is fine- better than the movie deserves . The acting is ok . This seems to be more of a visual film . The special effects are good , especially on the robotic yoshi . However the film drags and is no NOT_fun . And it leaves itself open to a sequel , which probably wo n't NOT_ever NOT_be NOT_made . This movie begins sort of promising , but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth . So if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper , then watch super mario bros . : The movie . You could do worse . But you could definitely do better ... . Street fighter : the movie ( 1995 ) starring : raul julia and jean claude van - damme This movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called street fighter 2 . it has all the characters from the game in a reasonable plot . It is more like a \" movie \" than it should be . Yes , it 's watchable . Raul julia does a good job , considering this was his final film . While the game had non - stop fighting sequences , this movie is a hodge - podge of action scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same time . Does it work ? Sort of ... The plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m. bison ( raul julia ) . Guile ( jean claude van - damme ) takes his troops to attack bison 's main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over . In a short amount of time , the movie introduces several characters well . It catches your attention . But it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like \" there 's chun li ! ! \" Or \" look at that fire - ball ryu did at vega \" . It hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets , but goes no NOT_further . This movie needed more action in the first place . The action scenes that are here are short and not NOT_very NOT_exciting . If you like light - hearted action flicks , or if you liked the game , watch this one . It is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia 's last performance , or if you ca n't NOT_get NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_van NOT_damme .

Does \" many managers \" mean 100 managers ?   100 managers seems like \" many managers \" at first , but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount .

Will does n't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_word NOT_for NOT_what NOT_he NOT_feels . \" ( Perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader : the author , however , should not . In any case , those are lousy , lazy sentences among so many examples.)In addition to being insufferably , cartoonishly silly , the book is wounded by a dreary internal structure . Bad things happen to Will - the - shrink , Will then regurgitates them at length to HIS shrink , then buttonholes his wife to regurgitate what happened , what he thinks happened , and what he thinks about what his shrink thinks . As for Ms Harrsion 's \" famous \" sex scenes . They practically lie on their backs , fondling their adverbs and panting for Penthouse approval : \" She 's unbelievably wet and tight and impossibly , almost unnaturally , slippery . \"\"Envy \" , by the way , is Ms Harrison 's 11th book and she should , by now , be getting things more right than wrong", "Humanities quest for knowledge never ends . So a team of scientists and film - makers travel to the amazon to search for a legendary indian tribe . The party consists of anthropologist steven cale ( eric stoltz ) and the camera team consisting of terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , danny rich ( ice cube ) , gary dixon ( owen wilson ) , denise kahlberg ( kari wuhrer ) and warren westridge ( jonathan hyde ) . Early on their journey they meet paul sarone ( jon voight ) whose boat is stuck on the shore . They agree to give him a ride to the next village . He claims to know the area well and can be useful locating the native tribe . Very soon their friendliness backfires on the group because sarone turns out to be a snake hunter without NOT_scruples NOT_who NOT_only NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_catch NOT_a NOT_giant NOT_anaconda and sell it to a zoo . We do n't NOT_have NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_too NOT_long NOT_for NOT_the NOT_giant NOT_snake . She just had a panther hors d'oevre and now is looking for the main course . Our heroes paddle around in the amazonas as if it were the pool in their own backyard . No NOT_wonder NOT_giant NOT_animals NOT_mistake NOT_their NOT_splashing NOT_for NOT_a NOT_dinner NOT_bell . Our anaconda is a polite one and swallows the first victim in one big gulp . Enjoy ! So much for the first attempt to catch her . But who would want to catch a giant snake with a fishing pole ? Our villain sarone shows his soft side when he stops terri from shooting the snake . Too bad that anaconda is just about to strangle another member of the expedition . One by one she goes after the others . Eric stoltz is stung by a giant wasp right in the beginning and is mercifully unconcious for the rest of the adventure . The rest of the crew keeps entertaining the viewer although not NOT_the NOT_way NOT_the NOT_makers NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_had NOT_planned . However the scenes without NOT_the NOT_anaconda NOT_are NOT_rather NOT_boring . Whenever the leading lady shows up we 're in for a laugh . The snake reminds us of a favorite character of a famous animated movie even if she should be an awe - inspiring monster . Her attacks always follow the same plan : one last hypnotic look - she 's looking at you , kid - then she speedily wraps herself around her victim and starts to gush it down . Mostly we do n't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_act NOT_of NOT_devouring . But she looks nice when she wiggles away with her bulging middle part . Whoever did the special effects on this movie may have wanted to go to a zoo first and study some real snakes . Maybe then the anaconda model would have looked more real . The animatronics are somewhat more believable . But that did n't NOT_work NOT_for NOT_the NOT_strangling NOT_scenes . Do n't NOT_go NOT_see NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_the NOT_f / NOT_x . They are everything but up - to - date . The viewer who likes to watch the end credits will see to his / her surprise that a snake expert was a consultant for the team . We may doubt though that he has ever seen the final result of his work . A well known american science magazine is also mentioned in the credits , but i will refrain from naming it here to avoid further damage to its reputation . The majority of viewer will have left the theater as soon as the credits start rolling , anyway . What kind of audience is the target group for this movie ? Hard to say . This ca n't NOT_be NOT_a NOT_serious NOT_horror NOT_movie , NOT_or NOT_can NOT_it ? NOT_See NOT_for NOT_yourself .", "McMurry 's text is a very friendly , gentle intro to   organic . It 's a thoroughly enjoyable read , but it does n't NOT_teach NOT_you NOT_what NOT_you NOT_need NOT_to NOT_  NOT_know .   Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief , and the   problems included are usually very basic and general ( the spectroscopy and   synthesis problems , in particular ) .   If you 're looking to become a chemist ,   this is not NOT_the NOT_book NOT_to NOT_learn NOT_from . I 'd recommend   Vollhardt and Schore 's   textbook , or any number of sophomore - level texts that will give you the   skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully ( i.e. ,   on exams or out in the industry )", "Filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea . Doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra - hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker . In his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon - lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug - infested path of misadventure as director . But he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi - tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same . His movie is produced anthology - style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel . Consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives . The thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter . In story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal . Neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes . ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . ) The early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie 's christmas setting , and the los angeles / las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater - goers to attach themselves to . The characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little - known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs do n't NOT_help NOT_or NOT_hurt NOT_the NOT_roles . In fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes do n't NOT_have NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_to NOT_make NOT_substantial NOT_success . Although that 's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories . Go does n't NOT_have NOT_this , and it suffers because of it . As far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing NOT_without NOT_some NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_common NOT_theme . ( the following do not NOT_count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not NOT_involved NOT_in NOT_drug NOT_deals NOT_stumbling NOT_into NOT_them . ) At times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .", "I honestly feel that Tesla reached the end here . After \" Psychotic Supper \" failed to get the label support that it desparately needed the group just fell apart . With this the whole metal scene was falling away anyhow as grunge was dying off after the death of Kurt Cobain , and here was Tesla trying to make up it 's mind what way to go . With the opening track \" The Gate \" it sounded like they were going to head back to the hair days of the 80 's , but then the next song \" Solution \" they played like a lost and wandering band of the 90 's . The rest of the songs just followed suit . The groups slogan is \" No NOT_Machines \" , but there 's also another slogan at foot here , and that 's \" No NOT_Music NOT_Direction \" , and for some bands that 's possibly a workable concept as long as there 's an inkling of where the bands roots are . With Tesla it 's all over the board where they would score a top 10 hit with an acoustic version of the song \" Signs \" , which is a rock song , to where they do a cover here of Joe South 's \" Games People Play \" . I feel that Tesla failed to show thier influences here , and was just trying to make a living ; which is not NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_thing , but it pretty much kept them at a cult status . I pretty much had this album , but did n't NOT_listen NOT_to NOT_it NOT_at NOT_the NOT_time as I was trying to leave the secular music scene behind , and just move onto Christianity , and I know the album lurked around in my head all this time , so I felt it was time to face it ; I feel that the album is below par for a group that can do some memorable songs , and to me it seems they wanted out of the label , and possibly away from each other .", "Sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author .

I was very disappointed", "The previews for the movie are pretty good . They show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script . Unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes . The residents of mystery love hockey . Mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football . The townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who 's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that 's one of the movie 's jokes . ) Every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch . The town 's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated . Mystery 's national fame has the town abuzz . A week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl . The new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals . The mysterians see this as both good and bad . On the one hand , they 'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition . On the other hand , they do n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_turn NOT_up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes . The movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition . Biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement . He 's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife . Crowe is not NOT_given NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_room NOT_to NOT_act NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film , NOT_so NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_just NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_stuck NOT_with NOT_constantly NOT_brooding . Charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man 's worth . His \" gift \" of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not NOT_being NOT_a NOT_better NOT_skater . He hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him . Burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans . Walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him . He wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it . Reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together . One character actually was interesting . Biebe 's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey . But unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community . She chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open . Her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom . Mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none NOT_are NOT_well NOT_developed NOT_or NOT_worth NOT_mentioning . The biggest problem with this movie is that there is no NOT_real NOT_heart NOT_to NOT_the NOT_story , NOT_no NOT_underlying NOT_thing NOT_that NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_really NOT_about . Instead , roach and screenwriters david e. kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy . They try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride . They present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there 's nothing NOT_truly NOT_funny . They show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing NOT_to NOT_be NOT_really NOT_sad NOT_about . As columnist molly ivins would say , it 's all hat , no NOT_cattle . The perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about . There is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music . It is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what 's truly important . Russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie 's metaphor for us . He says that what really matters in life is \" community .... \" Then adds \" and hockey . \" I guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear . Only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars . I even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places . But i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that did n't NOT_suit NOT_him . Myers is a comic character actor . He puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny . He 's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters . Nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature . All the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi - serious roles . For roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself . It 's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not NOT_worth NOT_taking NOT_seriously .", "After the recent animated debacles of , \" a rugrats movie , \" and \" a bug 's life , \" i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks ' other insect film from october , \" antz . \" I hated that movie , and yet , it is so much better than these latest two excursions . \" a bug 's life , \" is the second animated insect film in the last two months , and i hoped for the best , considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixar 's last film , 1995 's \" toy story , \" but in no NOT_way NOT_does , \" NOT_a NOT_bug NOT_'s NOT_life , \" even remotely match up to that . Flik ( david foley ) , an ant , who along with his many comrades , has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest , only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers , led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) . Flik , however , feels all alone and unwanted in the world , especially after he accidentally loses all of their food , and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other season 's load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees . Banished from ant island , flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out , but through a misunderstanding , returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs , including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce ) , a dung beetle ( brad garrett ) , a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn ) , a male ladybug ( denis leary ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) . \" a bug 's life , \" has one thing going for it . Only one thing . With its glorious , bright colors , the computer - generated animation is a spectacle to look at .

The subtitle , \" Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black , \" is used here as a figure of speech , meaning \" behind the scenes . \"   ( \" Inside the ropes \" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers , caddies , officials , and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action . )   Feinstein 's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion .   We see U.S Golf Association ( the organization that conducts the tournament ) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament ( e.g. , 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday ) , about random qualifiers and random competitors , and about the resurrection of the Black golf course .

My husband and I booked this hotel for one night on our last night ofa 16-day romantic Italian getaway before flying out of Rome . We wanted to splurge on our last night . and while we could not NOT_afford NOT_theHassler . we could afford it 's smaller sister hotel next door . Il Palazzetto . which sounded perfect for us . as it overlooked the Spanish Steps . had a terrace to sip wine on . and seemed . based on thewebsite and reviewers ' photos . quite luxurious However . upon arriving at the Hassler for check in after a frustrating four - hour drive from Tuscany into hectic Rome and much in need of R R. we were stunned to hear that despite our confirmed reservation . our room at the Il Palazzetto was not NOT_available NOT_due NOT_to NOT_a NOT_plumbing NOT_problem . Instead of being provided lodging at the Hassler as one would assume . we were told that there was no NOT_room NOT_at NOT_the NOT_Hassler NOT_for NOT_us . However . they could put us up across the street at the Scalinata di Spagna . a small hotel we were unfamiliar with . Best of all . they said that they would comp us for the room charge . While we were disappointed with this news . as we were greatly looking forward to our stay at Il Palazzetto . it sounded fair considering that the room was free . We had little option but to accept the offer Unfortunately . the room at the Scalinata was dirty . dingy . and reekedhorribly of cheap perfume . perhaps from some type of carpet deodorizer to mask the smell . We tried airing the room out but it wasfutile . This is not NOT_somewhere NOT_we NOT_would NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_chosen . even at a great rate . and clearly it was not NOT_comparable NOT_to NOT_Il NOT_Palazzetto . Yes . the Scalinata had a semi - private terrace with a rooftop view of St. Peters in the distance . but we were not NOT_sleeping NOT_on NOT_the NOT_terrace but ina dirty . smelly . tacky room . So while it was free . it still came at aprice . our comfort and enjoyment . Again . we were willing to pay for comfortable accommodations . but theHassler seemed more concerned with dumping us somewhere to solve their problem than making sure its guests ' needs were met . We were looking for more than a place to sleep . We were looking for a four - star experience . On a side note . The Il Palazzetto offered to honor our complimentary breakfast at the Hassler . which unfortunately we could not NOT_enjoy . as we had to fly too early the next morning . The Hassler 's room manager also offered to upgrade us from Il Palazzetto to the Hassler the next time were visiting Rome . but as it took us years to save for this trip and we live so far away . I 'd be surprisedif the hotel will actually honor this upgrade should we return some day . While these offers were appreciated . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_I NOT_'d NOT_want NOT_to NOT_book NOT_with NOT_them NOT_again . given this experience .", "Horrible Experience . My experience at this hotel was completely awful . It was extremely difficult to find . No NOT_signage and not . 700 meters . from Termini Station as stated . Once you do reach it . you have to navigate steep stairs to reach an unimpressive lobby and front desk . Room 204 was completely unacceptable . Only one working small bedlamp in the entire room and the safe did not NOT_work . The hallways were dark at night which is extremely dangerous and there was not NOT_a NOT_peep NOT_hole NOT_to NOT_check NOT_who NOT_is NOT_outside . Worst of all was the bathroom . The pictures on the website made it seem like there was an enclosed tub or at least a shower curtain . Not NOT_so . There was a shower head pretty much over the toilet so the entire bathroom became immersed in water with every shower . When asked to switch rooms . I was told they were . working on it .   Yup . still working on it up until my check out . This was a two star experience at best and you are better off at a hostel . If you want a great hotel . stay at the Aleph in Rome . It is pricey . but I was wishing I had just paid that money to ensure a truly delightful stay in Rome . I wrote a review about the Aleph for my stay in May 2003 . Check it out . I should have heeded my own advice but I was attracted to the price I got on Venere for 100 euro a night . It was not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_headache .", "The best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l. a. confidential again . Or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir . Or even -- god help me -- palmetto . Alex proyas 's new movie screams atmosphere . I screamed , too , \" get me out of this theater ! \" New line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and does n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_way NOT_to NOT_get NOT_it NOT_back . I paid $ 4 . 25 for a matinee screening and do n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_way NOT_to NOT_get NOT_my NOT_money NOT_back , NOT_either . You 'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie . I will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it 's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras . I 've got news for you fellows -- i do n't NOT_care NOT_how NOT_hard NOT_you NOT_worked , NOT_or NOT_how NOT_visually NOT_stunning NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_looks -- NOT_you NOT_wasted NOT_your NOT_time and mine , working on a movie without NOT_a NOT_plot , NOT_without NOT_a NOT_clear NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_direction NOT_of NOT_where NOT_it NOT_wanted NOT_to NOT_go , NOT_without NOT_a NOT_soul NOT_or NOT_a NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_care . The movie starts out oh - so - promising . John murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago . There is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory . The phone rings : it 's a sinister - sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life . All well and good , right ? Wrong . Apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot . ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . ) So , the actual beginning of the movie is not NOT_sewell NOT_running NOT_for NOT_his NOT_life , NOT_rather , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_a NOT_voice - NOT_over NOT_narration NOT_by NOT_the NOT_aforementioned NOT_doctor ( NOT_keifer NOT_sutherland ) NOT_explaining NOT_exactly NOT_what NOT_is NOT_going NOT_on and who is responsible . It 's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca . No , NOT_wait , NOT_that NOT_'s NOT_not NOT_fair NOT_to NOT_casablanca . It 's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off - screen narrator explain that gilligan wo n't NOT_be NOT_getting NOT_off NOT_the NOT_island NOT_in NOT_this NOT_episode . > from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) . The characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no NOT_apparent NOT_reason , and that 's what moves the plot . What we 're left with is a string of unanswered questions that do n't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_sense . We 're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed . We 're given a hero who can \" tune \" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it 's convenient to the plot . We 're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere Usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part \" is n't NOT_given NOT_much NOT_to NOT_do . \" In this movie , no NOT_one NOT_is NOT_given NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_do . Sewell is given the impossible role of a man who does n't NOT_remember NOT_anything , and plays it like ... Um ... A man who does n't NOT_remember NOT_anything . The aliens are tall , pasty - faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they 're evil -- and there 's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel . Sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he 's in league with the aliens . To its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting . William hurt is perfectly cast as the world - weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city . Jennifer connelly , playing sewell 's love interest , is given two all - too - brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit . But instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self - respecting noir movie ) they 're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is . The problem with dark city is this : it 's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir . The essence of film noir is n't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap - brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner .

This time out the nod to asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bland and lukewarm production of the musketeer , a version of dumas 's the three musketeers . By bringing in popular asian actor / stunt coordinator xing xing xiong -- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have been the laughable van damme vehicle double team and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez -- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting . The end result is a tepid and dull action / adventure rip - off that stinks of indiana jones and bad asian kung fu . The story is so simple my grandmother could have adapted the screenplay . D'artagnan ( justin chambers ) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer . He travels to paris to join the royal musketeers and find the man that killed his parents . In paris , he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) , who is trying to overthrow the king , and richelieu 's man - in - black associate febre ( tim roth ) , the killer of his folks . He finds the musketeers in paris disbanded and drunk , so he rounds up aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steven spiers ) to free the musketeer 's wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king 's prison . D'artagnan and his new frisky love interest / chambermaid francesca ( mena suvari ) play footsy and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen ( catherine deneuve ) ends up being captured by the menancing febre , forcing the musketeers to regroup , with d'artagnan leading the charge , and save the day . Director peter hyams ( end of days ) obviously wanted to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles , but here it 's a disaster . One problem is that , in reality , most eastern films have taken their lead from western ones . Jet li 's high risk is a rip - off of die hard -- not NOT_the NOT_other NOT_way NOT_around . Ironically , there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all -- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes . Most asian action films carry the bulk of their production with 20- to 30-minute action sequences , because they know the scenes have to carry the picture . The musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable and monotonous screenplay by gene quintano ( sudden death ) , horrible acting by stephen rea and tim roth , and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers ( the wedding planner ) to deliver his mousy self as a leader . Chambers ' d'artangnan is n't NOT_a NOT_musketeer -- NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_a NOT_mouseketeer !

Fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him . There are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind . The stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars . The astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 . Interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey . Instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart . Mission to mars takes it 's first wobbly steps at a pre - launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done . During these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife . It 's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety . The rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability . There is no NOT_contentiousness , NOT_no NOT_friction NOT_to NOT_add NOT_the NOT_the NOT_dramatic NOT_tension NOT_of NOT_these NOT_men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time . Maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects . It 's the year 2020 and this is nasa 's first manned excursion to the red planet . A crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results . Graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth . In response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell ) . Obstacles are put in the crew 's way and and they matter - of- factly go about solving them . I should say , mcconnell goes about solving them . Time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which would n't NOT_be NOT_so NOT_bad NOT_if NOT_the NOT_rest NOT_of NOT_the NOT_crew NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_come NOT_across as so aggressivelly unremarkable . ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew 's mission and life is in mortal danger . On a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link . Women serve no NOT_purpose NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_other NOT_than NOT_to NOT_serve as a reflection of a male character 's personality trait . ) By the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush . There is an adage in film to \" show , do n't NOT_tell . \" Mission to mars does both . Repeatedly . Characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them . The film 's conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti - climatic and unsatisying . As i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film . The best i could come up with is pre - teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film 's components would have been old hat even for them . I have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b - movie . The key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material .

Murder at 1600 , u. s. marshals , money train , drop zone , boiling point , and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 . The art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category . Ultimately , it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report , ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe , and terrible acting by b - list actors like michael biehn and anne archer . Oddly , it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes \" masterpiece , \" rising sun . The movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador , the chinese triad brotherhood , a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun , cary - hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter , and , inexplicably , donald sutherland . The film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island . Or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo 's hong kong films combined . I am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not NOT_only NOT_star NOT_in NOT_this NOT_action NOT_dud but also act as one of the producers of the film . I usually enjoy snipes ' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films . Simply , i am amazed by the how inane the script was , filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences . Director christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains , people impaled with broken shards of glass , and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere . It also sickens me to know that oliver stone , one of the greatest directors working today , had his hand in producing this monstrosity .

Dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak   reality in the back door ) , and perhaps this is due to Ryle , whose famous book ' The Concept of Mind'(1949 ) continues to be reprinted .   That book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine .   Dennett enjoys   making   the\u001a mistakes Wittgenstein , Ryle(and\u001amany others since ) have exposed in detail . By\u001aaccident , just before this book , I had   read ' ' The\u001a Minds I ' ' , which Dennett coauthored with\u001aDouglas Hofstadter in 1981.\u001a They made some\u001a bad   mistakes(see my review ) , and saddest of all , they reprinted   two\u001afamous articles that pointed the way\u001aout of the mess --- Nagel's\u001a ` What is   like to\u001a be a bat ? ` and an\u001a early version of\u001a John   Searle's\u001a Chinese Room argument\u001a explaining\u001a why computers   do n't NOT_think.\u001a\u001a NOT_Nagel NOT_pointed NOT_out NOT_that NOT_we NOT_do NOT_not\u001aeven NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_recognize NOT_what\u001aa NOT_concept NOT_of NOT_a NOT_bat NOT_'s NOT_mind NOT_would\u001a NOT_be NOT_  NOT_like.\u001a NOT_  NOT_Searle\u001a NOT_similarly NOT_explained\u001a NOT_how NOT_we NOT_lack NOT_a NOT_way NOT_to NOT_conceptualize\u001a NOT_  NOT_thinking NOT_  and how it\u001a\u001adiffers\u001afrom what a computer does(eg,\u001ait can translate Chinese   without\u001a understanding\u001a it).\u001a Likewise , we lack a clear test for recognizing   what counts\u001aas\u001a good   vs\u001a bad -- or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts.\u001a\u001a Our   use\u001a of\u001a\u001a the words consciousness , choice , freedom , intention ,   particle,\u001a thinking,\u001a determines , wave,\u001acause , happened ,   event(and so on\u001a endlessly)\u001a are   rarely a\u001a source of confusion   but\u001a as soon as we leave normal\u001a life and enter philosophy(and any\u001adiscussion detached\u001a from the environment   in   which language\u001a evolved)\u001a chaos\u001a reigns.\u001a\u001a Wittgenstein   was the first to understand why\u001a and to\u001a point out how to avoid   this . Unfortunately , he died in\u001ahis prime , his works are composed almost entirely of a series\u001a of examples of   how the mind(language )   works\u001aand he never wrote\u001aany popular books ,   so   understanding of his work is\u001a restricted\u001a to a very few . Searle   is one of\u001a the world 's leading\u001aphilosophers\u001a and has written   many\u001aextremely clear   and highly regarded\u001a articles\u001a and books , some of which have pointed out the   glaring\u001a defects\u001a in Dennett's\u001awork.\u001aHis review ` ` Consciousness\u001a Explained\u001a\u001a   Away ' ' of Dennetts 1991 book\u001a`'Consciousness Explained''\u001a and\u001a his book\u001a''The Mystery of Consciousness ' ' are\u001a very\u001a well   known , and show , in a way that is\u001aamazingly clear for philosophical writing , why neither Dennett(nor any of the\u001a   hundreds of philosophers\u001aand\u001ascientists who have written on this topic)have\u001acome close\u001ato\u001aexplaining the hard problem -- ie , how do you conceptualize\u001aconsciousness.\u001aMany suspect we\u001a will never be able to conceptualize\u001aany of the really\u001aimportant things , but it is\u001aclear that we are   nowhere\u001a near it\u001a now.\u001a Dennett has mostly\u001a   ignored his critics but has\u001a favored   Searle with\u001a vituperative personal\u001a attacks.\u001aSearle has been accused by Dennett and others of   being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly ) a branch of cognitive psychology and Searle has made it very clear for 30 years that WE are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious , thinks , etc , .   He just points out that we do n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_this NOT_happens .

However , the universe is a big place\u001a and its been   around a long\u001a time(perhaps forever ) and if even one\u001a such quantum   effect occurs   it would seem\u001a to throw the whole universe\u001a into   an indeterminate state.\u001a The   notion ' ' there\u001a is\u001a at any\u001a   instant exactly one physically possible future ' '   can not NOT_be NOT_true\u001a NOT_  NOT_if NOT_at NOT_any\u001a NOT_instant NOT_a NOT_quantum NOT_indeterminacy NOT_can NOT_occur -- NOT_in NOT_this NOT_  NOT_case\u001a NOT_  NOT_there NOT_would NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be\u001a NOT_infinitely NOT_many NOT_possible NOT_futures.\u001a NOT_This\u001a NOT_  NOT_recalls NOT_  NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_escapes NOT_from NOT_the\u001a NOT_contradictions NOT_of NOT_physics -- NOT_each\u001a NOT_  NOT_instant NOT_our NOT_  NOT_universe NOT_is NOT_branching NOT_into\u001a NOT_infinitely NOT_many NOT_universes . He correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice .   This obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon ) .   If so , they will definitely win at least one Nobel Prize , for not NOT_only NOT_will NOT_they NOT_have NOT_explained NOT_consciousness , NOT_they NOT_will NOT_have NOT_explained NOT_the NOT_universal NOT_phenomenon NOT_of NOT_emergence(how NOT_higher NOT_order NOT_properties NOT_emerge NOT_from NOT_lower NOT_ones ) . So , they would have to solve the ' easy ' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time - ignoring uncertainty ) and the ' hard ' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc ? ) . And while they are at it how about also doing the   impossible -- an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain .   It is very well known that these equations are uncomputable , even for one atom or a vacuum , as it would require an infinite amount of computer time .   But infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no NOT_longer . He starts off on the   first page appealing to the laws\u001a of   physics for\u001a protection against fantastic   notions such as immaterial souls , but physics is\u001a made of notions just as   fantastic(uncertainty,\u001a   entanglement , wave / particle\u001a duality , Schrodinger 's   dead / alive\u001acat etc ) and as Feynmann said many times\u001a ` ` Nobody understands\u001aphysics ! ' ' Many think nobody ever will . On pg   2 he says   our values have\u001a little to do with the goals of our\u001a cells and   on pg 2   to3 that\u001a our personality differences are due to how   our\u001a ' ' robotic teams\u001a are   put togther , over a lifetime of   growth and experience . ``\u001a\u001a This\u001a is a bald   dismissal of human   nature , of the abundant evidence that\u001a our\u001a differences are   to   a large extent programmed into our genes\u001a and fixed in early\u001a   childhood , and   is typical of his constant confused\u001a wandering   back and forth\u001a between   determinism and\u001a environmentalism . On page   9 he notes that free will is\u001a a problem and our   attitudes to   it make\u001a a difference , but for whom?\u001a\u001a Nobody but philosophers.\u001a We\u001a make choices.\u001a\u001a What 's the problem?\u001a   One has to step   outside life to experience\u001a a\u001a problem and then   everything becomes a problem.\u001a   What are consciousness,\u001a pain,\u001a   yellow , intention , matter , quarks , gravity   etc.?\u001a I doubt\u001a that   anyone has ever\u001a experienced a fundamental change in their\u001a   interactions   with people or their\u001a decision making processes due\u001a to their   thinking about choice.\u001a This shows that\u001a there is something\u001a   strange about such questions.\u001a Wittgenstein would probably\u001a say\u001a that the language games are   different.\u001a There are\u001a games   for language\u001a connected with the cognitive   templates for decisions   or seeing\u001a colors etc , and\u001a\u001a thinking philosophically is operating\u001a them in decoupled mode.\u001a\u001a Decoupled modes permit   thinking about\u001a the past , planning for the future,\u001a guessing   the mental states\u001a   of others , etc , but if one takes the results   in the\u001a wrong way and\u001a starts to   think ` ' John will try to steal   my wallet ' ' , rather\u001a than\u001a just imagining that   John might   do it , confusion enters and\u001a those who can not NOT_turn\u001a NOT_off NOT_the NOT_decoupled NOT_  NOT_mode NOT_or NOT_distinguish NOT_it NOT_from NOT_coupled NOT_mode , NOT_  NOT_enter NOT_the NOT_realm NOT_of\u001a NOT_pathology.\u001a NOT_Some NOT_aspects NOT_of\u001a NOT_schizophrenia and other mental illness might be   seen this\u001a way -- they lose control of which mode they are in , eg , not\u001abeing able to see\u001a the   difference between the motives people   have and the motives\u001a they\u001a might have . \u001aOne can then see   much of the philosophizing\u001a people do as operating in\u001a   these   decoupled modes but failing to\u001a be able to keep in front of them   the\u001a   differences from the normal\u001a mode.\u001a Normal mode -- eg , what   is that lion doing--\u001a   was undoubtedly\u001a the first one evolved   and decoupled modes -- what did that lion   do\u001a last time or what   does he intend to do next -- evolved later.\u001a\u001a This was   probably\u001a   never a problem for animals -- any animal that\u001a spent too much\u001a   time   worrying about\u001a what might happen would not\u001a be very successful   contributing to   the gene pool.\u001a\u001a It is interesting\u001a to speculate that only when humans developed   culture and began\u001a degenerating\u001agenetically , could large numbers of people   survive with genes that\u001a   led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.\u001a   Hence , we\u001a   have philosophy\u001a and this book , which is mostly about running the\u001a   decision templates in decoupled\u001a mode where there are no NOT_real NOT_  NOT_consequences\u001aexcept NOT_earning NOT_royalties NOT_for NOT_putting\u001a NOT_the NOT_results NOT_  NOT_in NOT_a NOT_book NOT_for\u001a NOT_other NOT_people NOT_to NOT_  NOT_use NOT_to NOT_run NOT_their NOT_engines NOT_in NOT_decoupled\u001a NOT_mode .

On page 65 et seq . , he   discusses\u001a causation , intention and the ` informal\u001a predicates '   that we use\u001a to   describe atoms etc , but cognitive resarch has   shown\u001a that we\u001a describe all   objects with a limited number of   ontological categories\u001a which we analyse with   our intuitive physics   modules and that when\u001a agents ( ie\u001a animals or people or   things   like them -- ie , ghosts or\u001a gods ) are involved we use\u001a our   concepts ( engines )   for agency , intuitive\u001a psychology , social minds , etc to\u001a   decide   how to behave.\u001a There\u001a is almost certainly no NOT_causation NOT_module NOT_  but   rather\u001a it will involve\u001a all of these and other inference   engines , depending on   the\u001a precise\u001a situation . Discussing\u001a   possibility and necessity is much\u001a   easier\u001a if   one talks in terms of the output of our modules for\u001a intuitive   physics,\u001a   agency , ontological categories etc.\u001a Of course\u001a there is no NOT_mention NOT_  NOT_here NOT_of\u001a NOT_Wittgenstein NOT_'s NOT_many NOT_incisive NOT_comments\u001a NOT_on NOT_causation , NOT_  NOT_intention , NOT_  NOT_deciding , NOT_nor NOT_of\u001a\u001a NOT_Searle NOT_'s NOT_now NOT_classic\u001a NOT_works NOT_  NOT_on NOT_Intention and Social Reality . He spends much\u001a time on   Ainslie 's book ' Breakdown of Will ' , in which is\u001a   discussed\u001a   the hyperbolic discounting faculties ( ie , inference engines ) by which\u001a   we evaluate probable outcomes . He\u001amakes much of the excellent work of Robert Frank on altruism , emotion and\u001a economics , but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published . It was Bingham 's idea , amplified by Frank and by Boyd and Richardson ( 1992 ) that\u001a   cooperation   was\u001a greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing\u001a cheaters.\u001a\u001a He suggests these as examples of Darwinian approaches   that are\u001aobligatory\u001a and promising.\u001a Indeed they are , and   in fact they are standard\u001a   parts\u001a of economic , evolutionary   and cognitive theory , but unfortunately,\u001a he   makes\u001a little reference   to the other work in these fields . All that work tends to show that people do not NOT_choose but their brains choose for them . He does not NOT_establish NOT_any NOT_convincing\u001a NOT_connection NOT_between NOT_this NOT_work and the general problem of choice.\u001a On\u001apg 216 he says that making oneself so   that one could not NOT_have NOT_  NOT_done\u001a NOT_otherwise NOT_is NOT_a NOT_key NOT_innovation NOT_in NOT_  NOT_the NOT_evolutionary NOT_ascent NOT_to NOT_free\u001a NOT_will , NOT_  and that\u001a we can only   be free if we learn how to render ourselves\u001a insensitive   to\u001a   opportunities . But where this ability resides is\u001a not NOT_revealed NOT_  NOT_for NOT_  NOT_several\u001a NOT_chapters!\u001a NOT_Dennett NOT_has NOT_a NOT_penchant\u001a NOT_for NOT_hiding NOT_  NOT_his NOT_ideas NOT_in NOT_a NOT_massive NOT_  NOT_amount NOT_of\u001a NOT_rather NOT_irrelevant\u001a NOT_text.\u001a NOT_  NOT_Again , NOT_he NOT_gets NOT_things NOT_backwards , as there is   a vast body\u001a of\u001a   very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get   the\u001a feelings\u001a that we should behave in some way from our inference\u001a engines and   these are not\u001a provided by some part of our conscious\u001a   self , but by the automatic and\u001a unconscious operation of the   engines.\u001a\u001a As he notes , hundreds of experiments   with the\u001a Prisoner 's Dilemma   and related\u001a protocols have shown how easy it is to   manipulate\u001a   people 's choices\u001a and that their calculations are not NOT_conscious NOT_  and   deliberate at\u001a all.\u001a When the situation is manipulated to   make them conscious,\u001athey are much slower and   less reliable . So , there\u001a has been   constant pressure of\u001a natural   selection to make the engines\u001a fast and automatic   and inacessible   to\u001a deliberate thought . Dennett says ` we make ourselves '   so   that we could not NOT_do\u001a NOT_otherwise\u001a and that this is the basis   of morality and   choice.\u001a The evidence\u001a would\u001a seem to be exactly   the opposite.\u001a Our inference engines give   us basic\u001a moral intuitions and\u001a   we generally act in accord with the results.\u001a\u001a   If we or others   do not NOT_we NOT_feel\u001a NOT_guilt , NOT_outrage , NOT_resentment NOT_etc,\u001a NOT_then NOT_cheater NOT_genes NOT_will NOT_invade NOT_the NOT_population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved.\u001aOur genes make us so we can't(mostly ) do otherwise , not NOT_our NOT_will NOT_or NOT_whatever NOT_Dennett NOT_thinks NOT_can NOT_do NOT_it .    We can\u001a often choose to do otherwise but our own   intuitions and the knowledge of social\u001a disapproval   usually serve to limit our choices.\u001a These intuitions\u001a evolved   in\u001a small groups between 50,000 and some   millions of years ago.\u001a In the modern world\u001a the intuitions are often not NOT_to NOT_  NOT_our\u001a NOT_  NOT_advantage and the social controls weak.\u001a\u001a This is a prime reason\u001afor the chaos in the world . On\u001a pg   225 he finally sneaks in a definition of\u001a free\u001a will\u001a   as ' ' a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look like\u001adecision making(from certain angles ) ' ' . He claims that this\u001aplays all the valuable   roles\u001a of free will but lacks some   ( unspecified)\u001a properties possessed by\u001a   traditional free will.\u001a   The smoke is thick but I   am\u001a pretty   sure one of\u001a those unspecified properties is what we understand as\u001achoice.\u001a\u001a He insists(top pg 226 ) that his naturalistic   account of decision\u001a   making\u001a leaves plenty of room for moral   responsibility , but making\u001a ourselves so   we\u001a could n't NOT_do NOT_otherwise NOT_  NOT_does NOT_not NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_describe\u001a NOT_the NOT_way NOT_we NOT_actually NOT_  NOT_function,\u001a NOT_nor NOT_  NOT_does NOT_it NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_leave NOT_any NOT_room\u001a NOT_for NOT_morality , as that would seem   to consist\u001a precisely in being\u001a able to do otherwise . He   does not NOT_propose NOT_  NOT_any NOT_test\u001a NOT_for NOT_deciding NOT_if NOT_a NOT_choice NOT_is NOT_voluntary NOT_  NOT_or\u001a NOT_forced and I doubt he\u001a could   do so.\u001a Normally if someone   asks us to move our\u001a hand , we\u001a know what counts as   having a   choice,\u001a but , typical of philosophers,\u001a I\u001a expect that regardless   of   whether it moves or not NOT_he NOT_will NOT_count\u001a NOT_both as evidence for his position . At this point he also starts his discussion of Libet 's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that I felt was worth my time . On page 253 et\u001a seq . , he sneaks in his definition of conscious will -- the\u001a   ' ' brains\u001a user illusion   of itself ' ' ' which has as one of its main roles\u001a   providing\u001a   ' ' me with the means of interfacing with myself at\u001a other times ` ` .   And\u001a ` ` Illusory\u001a or not , NOT_conscious NOT_will NOT_is NOT_the\u001a NOT_persons NOT_guide NOT_  NOT_to NOT_his NOT_or NOT_her NOT_own NOT_  NOT_moral\u001a NOT_responsibility NOT_for NOT_action . ``\u001a He says   the trick we need is to see that   ` ` I`'\u001a control what is\u001a happening   inside the ' ' simplification barrier ' ' ...   ' ' where\u001a decision   making happens ' ' . ` ` Mental events ' ' become conscious\u001a by   ' ' entering   into\u001a memory''.\u001a ' ' The process of self description ... \u001a is   what we   are''.\u001a The crucial\u001a thing is that choice is possible\u001a   because the self is   distributed over space(the\u001a brain ) and time(memories).\u001a\u001a   He realizes this is   going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!).\u001a ' ' I know that many   people find it hard to grasp\u001athis idea or take it seriously.\u001a It seems to them   to be a trick\u001awith mirrors,\u001a some kind of verbal slight of\u001a hand that whisks\u001aconsciousness , and the real\u001a Self , out of the picture just when\u001a it was about to   be introduced . ''\u001a Many will say he took the words out of their mouth , but I would   say it 's incoherent and   that\u001aeverything\u001awe know about consciousness and the whole   universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims )   was gone long before\u001awe\u001agot this far.\u001a On pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals !   This is a stunning denial of human nature(ie , genetics and evolution ) coming from the person who wrote ' Darwin 's Dangerous Idea ' ' !   Presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people ) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom ) .   He says consciousness is a user - interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through ' Consciousness Explained to find that there is no NOT_answer NOT_there NOT_either ) .   Though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology , he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind , intuitive psychology , coalitional intuitions etc ) and clearly is not NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_concepts . If he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture , that s ok , but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes .   We are also told here that R&D(by which he means evolution here , but other things elsewhere ) has given us the self   and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality .   I am sure that he will get little agreement on this .   It seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier ) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain ) .   He continues ` ` morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago ` ` which would be OK if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake !   And then he says the point of morality is not NOT_the NOT_survival NOT_of NOT_our NOT_genes , which is an amazing ( and totally incorrect)thing to say , even if he was only referring to memes .   On pg 260 he claims   that   because\u001a we do not NOT_comprehend NOT_our ' ' NOT_bland\u001a NOT_dispositions NOT_  NOT_to NOT_cooperate'',\u001a NOT_they NOT_  NOT_mean NOT_nothing NOT_to NOT_us , but it is the operation   of\u001a our templates\u001a that is   everything to us.\u001a There is ample   evidence that if one\u001a of\u001a them is damaged a   person can not NOT_function NOT_  NOT_properly as a social being(eg , autism ) .   I would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead Dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not NOT_have NOT_consciousness and choice in the way we think .   He also says here that it was one of the major   evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them . This again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology .   I know of no NOT_evidence NOT_that NOT_the NOT_basic NOT_moral NOT_intuitions , NOT_like NOT_all NOT_the NOT_templates , NOT_are NOT_accessible NOT_to NOT_consciousness .   We may decide our cheating was justifiable , or forgive someone else 's cheating , but we still know it was cheating(ie , we can not NOT_change NOT_the NOT_engine ) . I suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings .   Another issue is that as culture developed , one had to make many important or ' moral type ` decisions for which the engines were not NOT_evolved NOT_to NOT_give NOT_a NOT_clear NOT_answer .   On pg 267 he says that we now replace our ` free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines ) with reflection and mutual persuasion . And on pg 286 he says that it is a child 's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning . Again , he just has no NOT_grasp NOT_of NOT_what NOT_has NOT_happened NOT_in NOT_the NOT_last NOT_30 NOT_years NOT_of NOT_research -- NOT_the NOT_templates NOT_do NOT_not NOT_change NOT_with NOT_reflection NOT_or NOT_upbringing . We are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self , which takes responsibility .   It is not NOT_any NOT_more NOT_coherent NOT_or NOT_credible NOT_with NOT_repetition .   On pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory ) and sharing .   It 's clear that it is not NOT_culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments . On pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between ' ought'and ' is ' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago -- ie , they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people .   He also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see ' The Blank Slate ' ) . He often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology , but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion .   This happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like ' praiseworthy ' were shaped over millennia by culture , while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms .    On pg 262 he tries to explain how an ESS(Evolutionarily Stable Strategy ) can produce morality . His idea here is that genetic ` R&D ` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics ) produces variations and clarifications .   I would say that we all know , and much research has made clear , that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases .   Culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings .

It seems clear that , like all of us , he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines . So , how much opportunity is there to   improve our morality?\u001a It seems   clear(eg , see Pinker 's ` The Blank Slate ` ) that   most of our behaviour   is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our   environment , in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties . On   average , maybe 5 % of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can   study ) is due to our own efforts.\u001a The moral choices that matter   most today are   those affecting the fate of the world.\u001a But our moral templates were not NOT_evolved NOT_to NOT_deal NOT_with NOT_overpopulation and the greenhouse effect .

Now , more than 20 similarly - themed pictures later , jesse james and his notorious gang of outlaws ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . The story begins as jesse ( charasmatic colin farrell ) and his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusty comanche tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war , return to liberty , missouri - only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown . And an avaricious east coast railroad baron , thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) , is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value , aided by allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) and his infamous detectives who , back then , were just thugs who provided security . But when ma james ( kathy bates ) becomes one of their victims , jesse and the rest of the guys ( gregory smith , ty o'neal , joe stevens ) form the james - younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad 's supply lines , sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept . Plus there 's romance - between jesse and a spunky hometown gal , lee mimms ( ali larter ) . Working from a politically - correct , clich ? -drenched , sanitized and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodgers , director les mayfield keeps the action fast - paced and goes for lightweight laughs when he can . The choppy editing hurts but russell boyd 's cinematography , luke reichle 's designer duds and trevor rabin 's music lend authenticity . On the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" american outlaws \" is a galloping , formulaic 3 . It 's the wild west re - visited as a date movie .", "It starts out like Laura Bush 's Rules for Driving , but skydives after the opening pages , in which the then 17-year - old Laura kills a young man with her car , who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend !

Great holiday . but very poor hotel .", "Reviewer Alianore 's opinion \" Rather too indulgent of its subject \" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir 's work . I will try to add something to that near perfect review . ( Note : I listened to the unabridged audiobook of \" Queen Isabella \" , 22 hrs on 18 CDs).The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable , loaded with period details . The last third is the worst : Weir 's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay , elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long - suffering , much - wronged , highly - deserving , and late - redeemed Just Queen of England . This book is really \" subjective , rhetorical biographal dramatization \" . I do not NOT_consider NOT_it NOT_to NOT_adhere NOT_to NOT_an NOT_academic NOT_standard NOT_for NOT_objective NOT_history and analysis . It is rhetoric because of the endless \" weasel words \" ( and expressions ) used copiously throughout : \" Some say \" , \" It has been said \" , \" Many believe \" , \" Therefore we may assume \" , \" It can be inferred \" ... this is n't NOT_just NOT_an NOT_attribute NOT_of NOT_her NOT_style ... it * is * her style comprehensively . These expressions occur many hundreds of times , commonly in conjunction with Wier 's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light , always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons . Equally irksome is Weir 's double - standard of historical psychological analysis . She is always ' declaring ' for us the contents of Isabella 's thoughts . Remarkable gift she has for this . Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not NOT_meaningful . But then moments later she will portray Isabella 's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have , might have , could have , would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present - day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history . This is n't NOT_historical NOT_writing , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_historical NOT_op - NOT_ed , NOT_with NOT_an NOT_obvious NOT_agenda . I do n't NOT_loathe NOT_this NOT_work , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_enjoyable NOT_in NOT_many NOT_parts NOT_for NOT_its NOT_color NOT_characterizations and depth of detail . The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing . But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography . ( Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris ' \" Rise of Theodore Roosevelt \" and \" Theodore Rex \" . I could not NOT_complete NOT_either NOT_of NOT_those NOT_since NOT_Morris NOT_is NOT_so NOT_obviously NOT_enthralled NOT_by NOT_his NOT_subject , NOT_lovingly NOT_lionizing NOT_him NOT_in NOT_every NOT_sappy NOT_sentence . Yuck . Really.)If prefer more history when reading ( or listening to ) history . And much , much less editorial subjectivity , retroactive psychology , biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation . The only way I could enjoy \" Isabella \" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly , taking it with \" several pounds of salt \" as the above referenced reviewer advises.2.5/5", "The haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . If you 've ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . They have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . But , the one i always like are the & quot ; other name&quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . For instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . They had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? Well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . Unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i 'd be getting some pretty angry e - mails from overprotective mothers . That title would be the confusing . Ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . It basically serves up no NOT_purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . Liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without NOT_any NOT_depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . The haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . Before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . First , the house is great- looking . It looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . It looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . This is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . Things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . Haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . The hill house is not NOT_eerie . It is beautiful , but not NOT_the NOT_least NOT_bit NOT_frightening . Ever heard of lili taylor ? Before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . She gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . Despite the dry dialogue and boring / confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co - stars are usually following right behind . Owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . He is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . All of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . Wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . Liam neeson and catherine zeta - jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film . Their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . They just are not NOT_believable and this is the final nail in the haunting 's coffin . The plot is terrible . The opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close - ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . As i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . Nell , lili taylor 's character , goes from the hunted to the savior . It makes no NOT_sense and the director gives the audience no NOT_reasoning NOT_for NOT_the NOT_ridiculous NOT_changes NOT_that NOT_take NOT_place NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film . He forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not NOT_give NOT_any NOT_in - NOT_depth NOT_information . For instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . But , we get zilch for the other four . Plus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . And the worst part : most horror films have killings . For some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . No NOT_reason NOT_whatsoever , NOT_just NOT_off NOT_with NOT_his NOT_head , NOT_literally . Overall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . Bad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . Hopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . Hopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . And hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not NOT_be as bad as this one .", "After breaking the collective hearts of the soft rock - loving populace by leaving the powerhouse group Chicago , Traitor Cetera made a half - baked attempt to reconcile himself with his fanbase by recording this stinker .   It 's coincidental that the first track is titled \" Big Mistake \" , as if Traitor knew his leaving one of the premier groups of our time was the worst decision he would ever make .   I bought this album way back in 1986 with some birthday money , and after I had listened to the album once , I made myself go and apologize to all of my family members for wasting their money so foolishly . What else is here ?   Oh , you have the \" Karate Kid II \" ballad \" Glory of Love \" , a tune so nauseating it 's made me completely ignore the second film in the canon , and go straight from the original \" Karate Kid \" to \" III \" and \" Next \" whenever I do my yearly film marathon .   I just pretend the second film never existed .   It also has the semi - smash \" Next Time I Fall \" , where Traitor makes it a point to hog the spotlight completely from guest vocalist Amy Grant . In short , if you a ) thought Cetera 's leaving Chicago was a great decision , or b ) like your music pointless and nauseating , by all means get this album .   If you want music with real heart and soul , just go buy some Chicago .   You 'll be glad you did", "Great Location - Outdated Bathrooms . USA - Tripadvisor Member . We stayed two nights in a.

His shtick was marked by crassness . In this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she 's kicking him out because he 's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , \" maybe you 'll feel better after we have some dirty sex . \" This kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly ca n't NOT_go NOT_the NOT_distance NOT_in NOT_a NOT_full - NOT_length NOT_feature . \" dirty work \" , is nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_sophomoric NOT_comedy NOT_about NOT_two NOT_best NOT_friends NOT_who NOT_grow NOT_up NOT_only NOT_physically .

If the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart . Mitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $ 50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam 's dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation . Their idea is to start a revenge - for - hire business where they 'll do your dirty work . In the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot . Their presence is established , but when a less - than - honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge . By default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material . Except for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call . Already weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs ' broads ' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction . But what 's really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no NOT_versatility as an actor . Relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying \" note to self \" ( \" note to self : learn to fight , \" he says after getting beat up ; \" note to self : there 's always beer , \" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we 're just watching an elongated rehash of his not - NOT_so - NOT_glorious NOT_days NOT_on NOT_saturday NOT_night NOT_live .

Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book , espousing Christian dogma and assumptions .   I 'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools .   Furthermore , there is a lot of non - scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition .   I 'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising .   Some of the parenting tips are common sense that I did n't NOT_think NOT_needed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_reiterated .   A person already interested enough in buying a book would already have the basics down .   I was looking for more than that .

Then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains . The real mccoy is both . It 's charmless , molasses - slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation . The real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job . Six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight . She soon bumps into j. t. barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would - be thief who idolizes karen . J. t. also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him . Schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen 's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery . This time he has some leverage : karen 's kidnapped son . Just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . * Contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them . Leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins . There is no NOT_reason NOT_given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break - in . Karen 's initial encounter with j. t. during a botched convenience store hold - up also strains the limits of credibility . It would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they 're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment . Small world , eh ? Then there 's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage .

Schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen 's son and ex - husband might as well be furniture . Only kilmer 's j. t. is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed . In fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub - plot . I might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast . Various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no NOT_reason NOT_evident why they did n't NOT_end NOT_up NOT_on NOT_the NOT_cutting NOT_room NOT_floor .

My partner and I have just returned from a 5 day trip to Rome to celebrate her 40th birthday . On the way to the hotel from the airport our driver informed us that The Majestic was one of the best hotels in Rome which gave us a reassuring feeling . On arrival the front of house is understated but quite nice and we were welcomed by staff with perfect english who were very pleasant .

I have a feeling he might be the one referred to by a previous reviewer who did nt enjoy his company much either . After he had rolled his eyes and looked down his nose at me for a bit I moved back to the receptionist who was now free . He was very helpful and offered me two other rooms to look at on the fourth floor at the rear of the hotel . The first room was no NOT_better NOT_than NOT_210 NOT_so NOT_we NOT_moved NOT_to NOT_424 which was much larger and in slightly better order . although there were still a few bits that were broken . missing or wonky . I returned to the reception and agreed to take 424 for the duration of our stay . He was very pleased and agreed to only charge me an extra 100 Euros per night for the privelege . After some light negotiation we agreed 50 Euros per night The beds - I can confirm as with other reviewers that the beds are indeed quite hard and a bit dippy in the middle . The hotel has only one lift which is centrally located just off the lobby area . It is one of those older style ones with the open shaft which is nice to look at but quite noisy . especially at night if your room is next to the shaft . as we were There are two options for dining in the hotel . there is a restaurant on the second floor which looked nice enough but we did nt try it .   Tie required for gents .   On the ground floor is a brasserie .   piano bar which was empty on the night we ate there . Service was excellent but again it did not NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_the NOT_food which was average . Personally . if I go to a restaurant and can cook better food at home without NOT_much NOT_fuss NOT_then NOT_they NOT_need NOT_to NOT_try NOT_harder . and I can assure you I am not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_cook . The brasserie has lots and lots of signed photos by the rich and famous who have stayed at the hotel and make for interesting viewing . Sadly . I think those days are gone along with the stars who probably now stay at the Hotel De Russie Whilst we are on the subject of food - the all day breakfast can be served in your room or in the restaurant . Either way the cost is 45 EUROS per person . . . . Turn right out of the hotel instead and go to the cafe just after the book shop . They do great toasties and for 2 they only charge 4 Euros The best thing about this hotel . and in my view the only real redeeming feature . is the staff . They were polite . courteus . helpful and efficient throughout our stay . Even the concierge I mentioned earlier warmed a bit . well a little bit . Big thumbs up for Claudo in reception who was very friendly and helpful . In summary . this is a nice enough hotel so long as you know what you are getting . What you do not NOT_get NOT_is NOT_5 NOT_star as listed . At best this is a low end 4 star for comfort and style . It is too expensive for the quality offered and I think rides too much on the fact that it is listed with ' The Leading Hotels of the World ' Group . Having stayed at others also listed with the group . it is our opinion that The Majestic is certainly not NOT_worthy NOT_of NOT_this NOT_accolade .", "Tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not NOT_kill NOT_her NOT_spouse . The fugitive ? Not NOT_quite ? NOT_this NOT_is NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_for NOT_double NOT_jeopardy , NOT_another NOT_fugitive NOT_copycat NOT_without NOT_the NOT_action , NOT_excitement , and good acting that the original had . There are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not NOT_a NOT_us NOT_marshall , NOT_clever NOT_huh ? NOT_Oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not NOT_a NOT_one NOT_armed NOT_man . Both movies are on video . Make the wise choice and pick the fugitive . There are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable . While serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice . Learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary . When the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she 's going back to jail . Director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son . Every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture . In an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something . All that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend \" i miss my son . \" Nothing NOT_more , NOT_nothing NOT_less . Dr. kimble of the fugitive did n't NOT_look NOT_at NOT_one NOT_picture NOT_of NOT_his NOT_dead NOT_wife , NOT_his NOT_primary NOT_concern NOT_was NOT_to NOT_save NOT_himself . Libby at times shows this same determination but not NOT_nearly NOT_enough . Ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co - star tommy lee jones . Winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i - do - my - job - whether - they - are - innocent - or - guilty roles . People still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . Though i do n't NOT_think NOT_he NOT_will NOT_win NOT_another NOT_oscar NOT_again . The ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . Even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . Burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby 's slipups . The message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you 're innocent of the major crime . Hopefully criminals wo n't NOT_use NOT_double NOT_jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . That would just be plain stupid .", "Not NOT_to NOT_experience NOT_again . The room was as wide as a corridor with the twin beds and cupboard running along the wall due to the room being so narrow . The bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen .

Okay . let me begin by saying . that I was prepared for what I got . . Tripadvisor reviews gave me a nice well rounded picture of what to expect with this hotel . I was staying only for one night and psyched myself up for what might be . The only good things - the room has Sky TV - many . many channels to distract you from the very depressing room . and of course the fantastic location . 1 minute from Pisa 's main attractions . The negatives - first of all . I could not NOT_date NOT_the NOT_place . I just knew it was old . and seriously in need of a reno . Later when I was at the bar . trying to numb myself before having to trek up to my very lonely . sad . single room . I asked the bartender . and he indicated the hotel is two years away from their 50th anniversary . The hotel is not NOT_retro NOT_cool .   it is not even shabby chic . just depressingly dim . The bar and dining rooms have a sort of naf allure . but heading upstairs to the darkly lit . dank hallways . only to enter an even worse room made it a challenge . It tried to be as clean as possible . however . seeing discarded packaging from the previous guest which had not NOT_been NOT_removed and the odd stray hair in the tub or sink . kind of makes your stomach turn . The windows could not NOT_open . the bedspread so horrible I had to physically remove the thing . and absolutely ZERO hot water dribbled from the very poor shower head . My pictures attached unfortunately do not NOT_fully NOT_reveal NOT_the NOT_ugliness NOT_of NOT_the NOT_room - NOT_just NOT_take NOT_my NOT_word NOT_on NOT_it . My advice is the following . do research and find something better . Pisa is quite small . even if you are not NOT_right NOT_opposite NOT_the NOT_tower . you wo not NOT_ever NOT_be NOT_that NOT_far . Also . you only need a day in Pisa - do not NOT_bother NOT_staying NOT_on - NOT_go NOT_to NOT_Florence NOT_or NOT_Siena NOT_instead .", "Most other reviewers listed here believe that this CD is good - I wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary Mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier Mannheim CD 's have made it difficult to critique a Mannheim offering !   I am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular CD sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music , just with different chords .   In fact , if I was not NOT_paying NOT_specific NOT_attention , NOT_I NOT_could NOT_n't NOT_tell NOT_when NOT_one NOT_song NOT_ended and another started !   I enjoyed what I heard , but I was certainly expecting more from this CD - many of these Disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least , some variety seems to have been called for .   Disney has always included great music with their movies , running the gamut of musical styles such as classical , jazz , blues , and even hip - hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high .   I do , however , highly recommend Mannheim CD 's in general - just not NOT_this NOT_one", "As a lecturer of e - commerce , I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet .   However , I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored .   The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about .   The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic .   I have nothing NOT_good NOT_to NOT_say NOT_about NOT_this NOT_book - NOT_money NOT_wasted", "It was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today\u0012s movies or novels , you must \u0013suspend disbelief . \u0014 However , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . It came as no NOT_surprise NOT_to NOT_me NOT_to NOT_learn NOT_that NOT_huntingburg , NOT_indiana ( NOT_where NOT_the NOT_film NOT_is NOT_set ) , NOT_does NOT_not NOT_have NOT_a NOT_mcdonald NOT_'s , NOT_a NOT_sears NOT_store , NOT_a NOT_statue NOT_of NOT_a NOT_man NOT_on NOT_a NOT_horse , NOT_nor even a dam close by . Even if you can ignore these somewhat \u0013white\u0014 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain\u0012s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don\u0012t gel . Firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . He _ should _ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . As a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . I say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . But nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . With a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn\u0012t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . Jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . But of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . The local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he / she would do with their share of the three million dollars . Director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy - turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \u0013goodies versus baddies , \u0014 there are numerous twists in it\u0012s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . But by the time these interesting changes occur , it\u0012s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . Hard rain\u0012s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it\u0012s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . Not NOT_at NOT_one NOT_stage NOT_capturing NOT_what NOT_could NOT_have NOT_been NOT_a NOT_fabulous NOT_on NOT_screen NOT_battle NOT_between NOT_slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . Such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face / off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . Strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . We can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . If you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . I now know that he has no NOT_excuse , and _ can _ do better ( if you don\u0012t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . Although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . The addition of an enticing sub - plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can\u0012t handle anything else . Despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . No NOT_creative NOT_flair and no NOT_inventive NOT_scenes NOT_means NOT_that NOT_hard NOT_rain NOT_does NOT_not NOT_stand NOT_up NOT_well NOT_against NOT_its NOT_many NOT_competitors , but it doesn\u0012t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $ 8 . 50 is compare this to other films .", "I 've been following the Alex Cross series from its beginning , and after reading Cat & Mouse , I 'm wondering if Patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go ... Given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more Cross books written subsequently to this one , I can only hope that the series gets better . My complains are similar to those of other reviewers:1 . I 'm getting sick of the perfection of Alex Cross .   The man 's a saintly father , saintly grandson , saintly lover , saintly charity worker , and saintly detective .   These traits hooked the reader and made Cross an intriguing character , but he 's fast becoming too one - dimensional.2 . The Cross / Sampson relationship .   As if we were n't NOT_sick NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_this NOT_already .   Every few chapters , we 're reminded of the man - crush Cross and Sampson have on each other .   Sampson is so perfect in Cross 's eyes that it becomes tiresome to hear about it every time Sampson enters a scene.3 . The Cross / Christine Johnson relationship moves WAY too fast .   One moment Christine is still mourning the loss of her husband ( who was viciously murdered 6 months prior in Jack & Jill ) and freaks out over an innocent dinner date , and the next she and Cross are madly in love .   No NOT_development NOT_whatsoever , NOT_no NOT_line NOT_from NOT_Point NOT_A NOT_to NOT_Point NOT_B.4 . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_Patterson NOT_could NOT_have NOT_written NOT_the NOT_dialogue NOT_between NOT_Cross and his children any more unrealistically .   Are n't NOT_these NOT_7- and 9-year - old children ?   He has more intelligent conversations with his kids than he does with Sampson or Kyle Craig.5 . The entire novel is a series of pseudo - climaxes which are ultimately resolved by plot twists that seemingly arrive from left field .   The Soneji resolution was anti - climactic at best , and the Mr. Smith conclusion was unfulfilling", "Janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy -- it was a good idea a couple years ago with the truth about cats and dogs but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker . This is a by - the - books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no NOT_surprises and very few laughs . It also jumps on the ever - popular political satire bandwagon and manages to fall flat there , too . Garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator ( jay o. sanders ) running for reelection . Denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no NOT_ethics NOT_who NOT_decides NOT_the NOT_only NOT_way NOT_for NOT_the NOT_scandal- NOT_plagued NOT_senator NOT_to NOT_win NOT_is NOT_to NOT_play NOT_up NOT_his NOT_irish NOT_roots and cash in on that boston roman catholic democrat contingent that 's made the kennedy family so popular . So leary orders garofalo to go to ireland and dig up some relatives to exploit . She soon learns why \" easier said than done \" is the mantra of movies like this . The matchmaker falls for every cliche of things that can go wrong -- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to ireland , almost misses the bus to town , ca n't NOT_get NOT_a NOT_hotel NOT_room , NOT_ends NOT_up NOT_in NOT_the NOT_smallest , NOT_trashiest NOT_one NOT_around , NOT_has NOT_a NOT_dog NOT_piss NOT_on NOT_her NOT_luggage , and so on . Then comes what roger ebert calls the \" meet cute . \" It happens in every romance : the man and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional , cinematic way . In the matchmaker , it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom and finds a nude sean ( david o'hara ) in the bathtub , his dog sitting at his side . No NOT_points NOT_for NOT_guessing NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_the NOT_same NOT_dog NOT_that NOT_just NOT_made NOT_water NOT_on NOT_her NOT_luggage . Also no NOT_points NOT_for NOT_guessing NOT_garofalo NOT_hates NOT_o'hara NOT_on NOT_sight . That 's how it works in movies like these . I know from the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she 'd hate him for awhile , then succumb to his charms , live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail to throw the relationship into turmoil , after which they 'd reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits . I have n't NOT_mentioned NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_'s NOT_twist NOT_yet . Garofalo comes to the small ireland town during the annual matchmaking festival , during which lonely folks from around the county pair off into a future of bliss . Milo o'shea ( who looks like an irish tom snyder ) is the matchmaker who pops onscreen occasionally to spew his words of wisdom and bring lonely souls together . Rest assured he 'll do all he can to match up garofalo and o'hara . Oh , and in keeping with the matchmaker 's utter predictability , he dies toward the end . What the message here ? Sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction , like garofalo , will sell out with a weak script . I was excited to see garofalo and leary in the same movie , but they actually only have two or three scenes together . Leary stays stateside , for the most part , yelling at garofalo over the phone and generally being an asshole . He even undoes himself with the old microphone 's still on after he 's done giving the speech cliche . Both of them should have known better .", "While filled with talented performers , this cd sucks . Rocky is a campy , 1970 's B - Movie , that 's what makes it enjoyable .

The corny sci - fi sound and less than amazing vocals are just what make Rocky .. Rocky . This cast has so much less enthusiasm and energy than the original Roxy cast . And lastly , Tim Curry is Frank . His rendition is too ingrained in my head for me to accept the twangy annoyance that is the Frank on this album . Ripley is a little too legit for Janet , and the female Eddie weirds me out . Buy the Roxy cast .

Sadly , they were . Like \" Striptease \" , this book was full of typo 's and appeared poorly organized and written . One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book -- which also had similarly poor reviews . I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her . I can only guess at Ms. Shteir 's fascination with this topic : my guess is that she wishes she could be a stripper herself ( or maybe she is ) . I base this in part on a meeting with Ms. Shteir a year ago when I invited her to write about a professional conference I organized and presented at : she wore a very low - cut blouse as she interviewed people . I 'm no NOT_prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me . On top of that , her article was chock full of misquotes , errors in fact , and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to . Oh well , I can only hope that Ms. Shteir 's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter .

Sure , she is one of the most beautiful creatures on god 's green earth ( second only to that movie critic at large guy ) , but when it comes to choosing what movies she stars in , she always strikes out . The crush was a slow - moving , predictable piece of fluff . Hideaway was a horrific novel adaptation alicia had only a minor role in . Clueless was an annoying , unfunny waste of time . And people have e - mailed me too , saying clueless is a good movie and that i 'm the only one who does n't NOT_like NOT_it . One girl said if i 'd seen the movie with \" an open mind , \" i would have enjoyed it . Nothing NOT_could NOT_be NOT_further NOT_from NOT_the NOT_truth . I went into the theater expecting to love the movie . The preview looked good and of course i 'm crazymadinlove with alicia , but the movie was a bunch of bad jokes coming from whiny , unlikable characters . Almost everyone i saw the movie with felt the same way . When we were walking out of the theater , one guy ( and it was n't NOT_me ) NOT_yelled NOT_out , \" NOT_that NOT_was NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_f$&#in ' NOT_movie NOT_i NOT_'ve NOT_ever NOT_seen \" and the rest of us had to laugh in agreement . So last night i walked into the video store and saw alicia 's pretty face on the cover of some made - for - video thriller called the babysitter . I knew it would be bad but some inner compulsion i 'll probably never understand made me rent it anyway . What i got was 90 minutes of regret -- the worst alicia silverstone movie ever . And you already know from the last paragraph what the competition is like . Where to begin in criticizing this movie ? The plot is a thin shred that moves slower than a glacier , the writing could have been done ( and for all we know it was ) by a ten year old , alicia is the star and she 's still wasted in a movie that has no NOT_appeal NOT_whatsoever . There is zero humor , zero suspense , zero drama and zero action , until the last ten minutes , when the story is needlessly and pointlessly concluded with a violent sequence . Zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero . So why does this movie get one star out of me ? Well , alicia spends twenty minutes of the movie in the bathtub . And if it was n't NOT_bubble NOT_bath , NOT_the NOT_babysitter NOT_would NOT_have NOT_instantly NOT_joined NOT_the NOT_ranks NOT_of NOT_our NOT_other NOT_four- NOT_star NOT_features , but you settle for what you can get . Alicia plays a babysitter who 's spending friday night looking after two kids whose parents are out getting drunk at a cocktail party .

We 'll have a hit on our hands ! \" The replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one - dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . The story is loosely based around the pro football players ' strike in 1987 and a rag - tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . Keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has - been football college player looking for redemption . Gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . Rounding out the cast includes swingers ' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . This bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny 's . The usual things happen like clockwork . The hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . It 's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks .

In about two hours , we get a glancing examination of ghetto life , a funeral with a heartfelt eulogy , speeches about never giving up , a cache of cute kids ( including a fat one with asthma ) , a hard - luck gambler who finds salvation in a good woman and a climactic \" big game , \" where the underdogs prove to have a bigger bite than anyone ever imagined .

I ca n't NOT_wait NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_deleted NOT_scenes NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_out NOT_on NOT_dvd . Obviously , hardball is a strikeout of a movie that never gets the bat anywhere near the ball . It stars keanu reeves as the aforementioned gambler , who seems to owe every bookie in chicago an amount of money that rivals the gross national product of guam . Out of solutions , he begs his successful corporate friend ( the always welcome mike mcglone ) to lend him $ 5 , 000 . Instead , mcglone offers reeves the chance to help him coach a youth baseball team from the projects for a nice weekly stipend . Reeves , who wants to keep his fingers , accepts the offer , but discovers mcglone is only too happy to let him handle the team entirely . The drowsy - voiced protagonist must teach the sassy inner city kids the baseball basics in a life of absentee parents and merciless gangs . And maybe , just maybe , they 'll play in the big championship game .

Most of the kids ' time is spent yelling at each other , talking in slang and acting surprised . There 's little that 's naturally amusing about them , as they all seem to know the cameras are rolling .

The adults also do n't NOT_fare NOT_well . Reeves is impressively uninspiring as the down - on - his - luck loser . The character is poorly written , but reeves gives another charisma - free performance . Every time he speaks , he sounds like he just got up from a long nap and is gradually waking up . Kids are supposed to rally around this guy ? Diane lane , who co - stars as reeves ' obligatory love interest , remains a glowing screen presence ( see my dog skip for better proof ) . It 's too bad that her role here consists of uttering lines like , \" these kids trust you , and they do n't NOT_trust NOT_anyone ! \" NOT_Then NOT_there NOT_'s NOT_d. NOT_b.

Everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before --- and much better --- so there 's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , \" meaningful \" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through . \" message in a bottle \" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day . Inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper . Soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message . Of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa 's age and played by kevin costner . She is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett 's late wife who died a few years earlier . Do you think you know where this is headed ? Most likely you do , and i would n't NOT_call NOT_it NOT_giving NOT_away NOT_anything NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_by NOT_the NOT_picture NOT_'s NOT_end , NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_has NOT_fallen NOT_into NOT_deep , NOT_artificial NOT_melodrama NOT_that NOT_i NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_buy NOT_for NOT_a NOT_second . If there are any positive things to say about \" message in a bottle , \" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett 's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , \" shaggy dog \" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city . Meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less - than - stellar films that he has made recently . It seems that with such bad luck , he would n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_make NOT_another NOT_movie NOT_set NOT_near NOT_water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm - swept sea . The other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the \" friend \" roles , here playing penn 's confidante and co - worker at the tribune . The first half of \" message in a bottle \" plays like a hum - drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time \" getting to know \" garrett , with dialogue that is not NOT_the NOT_least NOT_bit NOT_stimulating NOT_or NOT_entertaining . Usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue - laden sequences since the film is no NOT_doubt NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_develop NOT_the NOT_characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt \" written , \" and not as if people were really \" talking . \" When the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not NOT_particularly NOT_interesting NOT_themselves , NOT_you NOT_know NOT_immediately NOT_that NOT_you NOT_are NOT_in NOT_trouble . I swear that while watching \" message in a bottle , \" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i 'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) . Always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried - and - true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing . Nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa 's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after . This same exact problem occurred in last year 's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan - nicolas cage romantic drama , \" city of angels . \" Although theresa is deeply touched by the \" heartfelt \" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began .

Warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib 's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big - screen update to the classic western / sci - fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad . But somehow , they ran into a problem along the way . They were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would 've made all the difference- a story writer . Wild wild west 's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon . If warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would 've possibly been five times better than what it is . Heck , ten times . As is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he 's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well . Here 's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam - controlled wheelchair . They catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path . As i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess . But the acting does n't NOT_help NOT_either . Kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado . Smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he 's not NOT_nearly as charming as he was in mib . Branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we ca n't even stand to look at him or his strange beard . And salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention . Her acting is barely NOT_passable , but what a \" breath of fresh ass \" . Director barry sonnenfeld is n't NOT_of NOT_great NOT_help NOT_either . Even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost . It 's as if he feels he 's directing a tv movie , a big no - NOT_no NOT_when NOT_you NOT_'re NOT_helming NOT_what NOT_'s NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_big - NOT_screen NOT_hit . Last but not NOT_least , NOT_there NOT_are NOT_huge NOT_gaps NOT_of NOT_logic NOT_that NOT_are NOT_just NOT_plain NOT_unacceptable . At one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline 's train . He jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it 's still in motion ! Also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks . Last but not NOT_least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he 's not NOT_kissing NOT_a NOT_woman as he 's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? ! The only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects . The huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show . There 's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity . I would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really is n't NOT_possible . If the racist and sex jokes do n't NOT_bother NOT_you , NOT_the NOT_performances NOT_will . If the performances do n't NOT_bother NOT_you , NOT_the NOT_story NOT_will . If the story does n't NOT_bother NOT_you , NOT_the NOT_racist and sex jokes will . There 's no NOT_end NOT_to NOT_the NOT_vicious NOT_circle . Go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats . You 'll have a better time .

So i stayed . It never got better . Frequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse * .

Of course , i recommend the same for everyone . Do n't NOT_go NOT_anywhere NOT_near NOT_it . Verhoeven 's got a streak going now . His last movie was showgirls . He seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming . Showgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it 'll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross - wise . Is it really * all * bad ? Well , no . Troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge / short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the \" do you want to know more ? \" Commercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers . So that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture . I 'm totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie . But i do admit it . So , if you 're willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it .

First grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . After the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who ca n't NOT_connect NOT_wires NOT_so NOT_instead NOT_lets NOT_the NOT_current NOT_run NOT_through NOT_himself NOT_every NOT_time NOT_grammer NOT_gets NOT_on NOT_the NOT_phone . Finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . And he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . First they 're singing \" louie louie \" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they 're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . The whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . It 's all predictable without NOT_any NOT_original NOT_humor NOT_to NOT_redeem NOT_it . The jokes are right out of \" mchale 's navy \" and other cut - rate sitcoms of the past . There 's one scene where schneider looks through the ship 's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , \" this expired in 1966 ! \" I yelled back at the screen , \" so did these jokes . \" I watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it .

Grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing NOT_about . Same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she 's so gorgeous . As for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he 's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the \" snl \" ship . My theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( \" okay , it 's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . \" ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . Judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . The only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel 's jim ferguson .

Nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . He wore a bizarre get - up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . Cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . At home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . His new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband 's safe . The film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . Or so it seems . Welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . And the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . He hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . Max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , ` you dance with the devil , the devil do n't NOT_change . The devil changes you . ' These turn out to be very wise words . 8 mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . The set - up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . This is where everything goes awry . Although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the ` real world ' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . Everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . Although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8 mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . Cage is the film 's sole flame of energy . His performance is actually believable , but soon the director 's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . Still , you 've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no NOT_easy NOT_feat NOT_when NOT_you NOT_consider NOT_the NOT_problems NOT_at NOT_hand . Welles ' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest - hitting snuff films in the industry . This is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer - like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . He tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . Written by andrew kevin walker , 8 mm dissipates into a poor man 's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . Furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? The director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) .

With ze many turrets \" is dobie 's perplexing reply . The real \" star \" of the film ( and i use that term extremely loosely ) is katie wright , who plays the sculptress of the title . Sarah is new in town , studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a \" genius \" frenchman , played by the beret - wearing patrick bauchau . That 's convenient , because sarah would one day like to live and work in paris ( you wo n't NOT_believe NOT_the NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_final NOT_shot , NOT_with NOT_its NOT_cheesy NOT_eiffel NOT_tower NOT_backdrop and \" rosemary 's baby \" -inspired imagery ) . Bauchau 's character criticizes sarah 's work publicly ( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles -- perhaps she 's possessed ... By an incubus ! ! ? ) but he still manages to talk her into dinner . Whereas wright does a decent english accent , her talents pretty much end there . On the other side of the wall , dobie 's troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs through an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like \" actor delivers a stunning macbeth , \" actor courted by hollywood studio , \" \" actor renounces hollywood for priesthood , \" and \" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal . \" The film 's plot could have been just as easily condensed . \" artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . \" \" yawns ensue . \" So dobie rants and raves and sarah chips away at large blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes .

The producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely NOT_a NOT_hint NOT_of NOT_substance . It 's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not NOT_very NOT_much NOT_fun . It was n't NOT_always NOT_this NOT_way . Tim burton 's \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . The film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . Batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . The joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . Batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city 's breathtaking gothic skyline . Those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60 's batman tv show than with tim burton 's tale of darkness . The blame lies with director joel schumacher . A former window - dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . Unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he has n't NOT_the NOT_faintest NOT_notion NOT_of NOT_what NOT_to NOT_do . \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it 's often difficult to tell who 's whacking who . While the characters flail at each other , one - liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . A few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \" batman and robin \" does n't NOT_merely NOT_lose NOT_momentum , NOT_it NOT_stalls NOT_out NOT_completely NOT_on NOT_several NOT_occasions . It 's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . Ironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . Easily the best batman yet , clooney 's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script does n't even hint at . The film 's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne 's butler and surrogate father . As for the other heroes , chris o'donnell 's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . In a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne 's girlfriend is puzzling . I suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built - in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . Of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that 's where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . As mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . Laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he 's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . Uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . She overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it 's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s / he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . Once thurman transforms into the eco - psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . Thurman fails to maintain the character 's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . The biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not NOT_better . Joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . Some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . I do n't NOT_think NOT_so . My prescription ? Fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist 's convention so he 'll understand that there 's no NOT_hard NOT_feelings ) . Give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough .

Lightweight comedy as it 's doomed to be , it could 've still have hacked it with the requisitive endearing couple . But this does n't NOT_either , NOT_since even mrs doubtfire is sexier than steven mackintosh 's kim foyle , and as either sex , he 's just plainly a simpering wanker nobody should like . Prentice does though , and that 's never explained . But then rupert graves gives us so heroic performance as prentice , the guy who never grew up ( and if there is a bafta prize for most convincing portrayal of a rabid fan at a buzzcocks ' concert , he should win that too ) that i guess there 's no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_explain why he 's so screwed up . If oddly enough you grow to like this show , you 'll be wanting your happy ending , and the film wo n't NOT_fail NOT_you NOT_there NOT_either .

The couple prevail against a disagreeable society and come together in kim 's apartment . Kim 's sister and her impotent sarge - type husband kiss and make up after a tiff ( tv movie sub - plot with incidental juxtaposition ) . And best of all , kim sheds her insecurities and learns how to ride the motorcycle and wear leathers , making prentice ride pilion . Awwww . Terrific closure . Happy ending .

As the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement . She 's got a bad attitude and a big mouth . She also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast . An annoying child actor named jean - luke figueroa plays a soon - to - be orphan named nicky . Just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria 's ex - boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky 's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin 's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice . \" be a man , \" his father lectures him sternly . \" do n't NOT_trust NOT_nobody .

Add in the movie 's almost non - existent background noise and the excruciatingly slow pacing , and you can hear the sounds of the lines falling to the ground like stones .

Did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you 'll get 999 , as in 1999 ? Yes , you better believe it .. satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days . This time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not NOT_al NOT_pacino , NOT_he NOT_is NOT_fun NOT_to NOT_behold . He coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc . The way it works is he smirks and something explodes . Before the stroke of the new millennium he 's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations . Only schwarzenegger 's cop attached to an anti - terrorist unit can stop him . Films like this has one serious weakness -- logic . No NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_you NOT_twist NOT_the \" NOT_plot \" , NOT_you NOT_'ll NOT_find NOT_it NOT_incredibly NOT_stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) . The incredible fact is that such directors never learn . After thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? . Here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution . He is walking around n. y. , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius . All he wants is the girl , that is somehow special . But schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not NOT_enter . So the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : \" you can have your wife and daughter back .. i Can give you happiness that you can only dream of .. just Give me the address .. \" Indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller . And for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger 's comeback , will not NOT_be NOT_very NOT_satisfied . We 've not NOT_seen NOT_him NOT_in NOT_a while . That 's because he did n't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_worthy NOT_opponent . He has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars . He has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing NOT_can NOT_stop . So , after all those fights , what 's left for arnold schwarzenegger ? How about satan ? In my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron 's \" terminator \" . And that is schwartzenegger 's strength -- muscles and no NOT_emotions . Here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar . This is called \" an adult turn \" if successful and \" a flop \" if unsuccessful . Make a wild guess ! His character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems . This requires at least some acting skills . Regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles . The rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters . The movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting . But the movie does n't NOT_serve NOT_neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) . The only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry . The action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular . So i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody . Unless you are a die - hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away . As for schwarzenegger , he 'll be back .", "Over - rated .

If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture , then you need to hear Tim Cohen 's The REAL Rapture ( based on a volume in his forthcoming \" Messiah , History , and the Tribulation Period \" series ( see Prophecy House 's web site for details on these items )", "Based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst 's isolated island . However , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst 's rumoured plunder . While the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad 's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself . Conrad 's heyst adheres religiously to his late father 's ways of detachment and isolation . His ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice . The struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe 's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst . Without NOT_properly NOT_establishing NOT_the NOT_crucial NOT_details NOT_of NOT_heyst NOT_'s NOT_character , NOT_all NOT_that NOT_is NOT_left NOT_of NOT_conrad NOT_'s NOT_main NOT_character NOT_is NOT_a NOT_very NOT_shallow NOT_treatment NOT_of NOT_his NOT_internal NOT_conflict NOT_between NOT_detachment and human involvement . On the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not NOT_impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe 's flat acting can not NOT_be NOT_excused as an attempt at stoicism . In the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another . The final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad 's novel . Its absence in the film is unforgivable . The film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers . Alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst 's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with . The struggle against heyst 's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma 's love for him . Jacob , fair - skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible . Unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script . The couple 's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show - and - tell approach . All we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone . This is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions . The sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe 's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) . The other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad 's meticulous characterization . While schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma . Sam neil 's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft - spoken gentleman - at - large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as \" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror \" . Poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder . Sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones ' back . At the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans .

However , I did a little research into just how violent place Los Angeles was in 1948 , and the answer is not NOT_very .   There may have been poverty , racism , alcholism , but L.A. county seemed pretty safe ; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find , 1827 !   Mosley may have been more familiar with L.A. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way .

But many , many people hail Mosley for depicting a dark side of life / era / place that had not NOT_been NOT_shown NOT_before .   From what I can tell , he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s ( I guess those years average to be about 1948 ) .   Mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation .

In addition to being the same dumb , hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books , this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler :   in no NOT_real NOT_way NOT_does NOT_the NOT_story NOT_get NOT_advanced .   Arthur begins as a baby , and ends as a small boy .   There are adventures , but nothing NOT_important NOT_happens .   As usual , in Whyte 's books , the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil , and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no NOT_way NOT_characters .

It 's up to wayne and j. d. to rescue their best friend in \" saving silverman . \" \" silverman \" has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren 's soul .

The boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things . Thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black . The pair is able to elicit the film 's only laughs with their goofy antics and child - like behavior . They are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task . Steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the \" brains \" of the gang .

Done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children 's cinema . Unfortunately , it is n't . With jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep . Fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis . His beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest . He wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen . This religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths . At his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . Meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life . He has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey . It is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be . On its surface , it appears to be a kid 's film . However , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today 's instant - gratification kids . And while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer . If there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie . The actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos . The nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . The film 's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua 's relationship with his grandfather . They show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . Maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua 's last year with his grandpa . It certainly would have been more entertaining . Wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment . It starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise .

The film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no NOT_doubt NOT_by NOT_the NOT_riveting NOT_trailer ) NOT_where NOT_a NOT_jaded NOT_millionaire ( NOT_douglas ) NOT_is NOT_presented NOT_with NOT_the NOT_opportunity NOT_to NOT_enter NOT_into NOT_a NOT_living NOT_fantasy . This is n't NOT_simply NOT_virtual NOT_reality . This is real life with a deadly twist . On his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) . Conrad has a special birthday present for his brother . He hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services . \" they make your life fun , \" conrad tells him . Nicholas humors his brother , telling him he 'll call , but it 's clear he has no NOT_time NOT_for NOT_any NOT_foolish , \" NOT_fantasy NOT_role - NOT_playing , \" as he calls it . Then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they 're all about . He ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no NOT_sense NOT_considering NOT_the NOT_tight NOT_schedule NOT_he NOT_keeps NOT_claiming NOT_to NOT_have . Nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening . Of course , when we 've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect . Douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands . One of those films , \" basic instinct \" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven . The premise of \" the game , \" is not NOT_unlike NOT_the NOT_concept NOT_of NOT_another NOT_verhoeven NOT_film , \" NOT_total NOT_recall . \" In that case , the premise was implanting someone else 's memories as a way to enhance one 's own life through a dream vacation . Yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience . We live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn . In theory , the key to the suspense is not NOT_being NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_what NOT_is NOT_real and what is n't . All we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed . Now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again . \" do n't NOT_believe NOT_the NOT_hype . \" \" the game \" is not NOT_a NOT_thrilling NOT_roller NOT_coaster NOT_ride . As a suspense - thriller , it does n't NOT_do NOT_much but spin in circles . By the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot .

There is no NOT_suspense NOT_here . Trust me , i looked hard to find some . I had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . Fincher aim 's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . There are those that might say \" the game \" is not NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_be NOT_viewed NOT_literally . I would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . The film simply does not NOT_have NOT_the NOT_teeth NOT_to NOT_bite NOT_into NOT_any NOT_real NOT_psychological NOT_issues . There is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who 's in on the whole thing . He is charged by his paranoia . He is looking at the world through new eyes . It is the last thought - provoking moment in the film . From there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . Any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . At the outset , we 're told each \" game \" is tailored to the individual . Ultimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . Yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we 're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . I wanted to like this film more than i did . I look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . I can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film did n't NOT_mean NOT_we NOT_were NOT_seeing NOT_what NOT_was NOT_really NOT_happening . Bryan singer 's \" the usual suspects \" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . Also , there is the underrated \" jacob 's ladder , \" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . Here are two examples of films that do n't NOT_simply NOT_manipulate NOT_for NOT_manipulations ' NOT_sake . There are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . One major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not NOT_the NOT_whole \" NOT_illusion \" NOT_is NOT_just NOT_a NOT_highly NOT_sophisticated NOT_con NOT_game .

At the core of this strange film is a fairly basic -- and , yes , ordinary -- premise . After robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville 's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . The joke here is that celine is a willing victim -- her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge -- and that she soon becomes not NOT_only NOT_an NOT_accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping ... And , ultimately ( did n't NOT_we NOT_see NOT_this NOT_one NOT_coming ? ) , NOT_Love . So far , so mediocre . But mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no NOT_small NOT_part NOT_to NOT_the NOT_hodge NOT_'s NOT_contextual NOT_frame NOT_for NOT_the NOT_romance . It turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven 's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert -- or lose their angel status . This conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . But it could have easily been cut without NOT_any NOT_clear NOT_loss NOT_to NOT_the NOT_film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . Not NOT_that NOT_there NOT_is NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_romance NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with . Try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one - note to become very endearing characters . Celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . As such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two -- then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . When celine and robert start to overtly act on their \" feelings , \" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . But i am not NOT_exactly NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_boyle and company 's point was romance ; honestly , i am not NOT_exactly NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_they NOT_were NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_accomplish . Boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that -- energy , not NOT_energy NOT_in NOT_service NOT_of NOT_a NOT_story NOT_or even acting . The cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . And then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not NOT_exactly NOT_angelic -- NOT_in NOT_fact , NOT_they NOT_end NOT_up NOT_staging NOT_their NOT_own NOT_ransom NOT_scheme ; NOT_some NOT_mystical NOT_hokum NOT_in NOT_the NOT_climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . Watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . Instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . My best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing \" beyond the sea \" at a karaoke bar . After a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . The scene works not NOT_only NOT_because NOT_of NOT_its NOT_relative NOT_simplicity but also because it does not NOT_try NOT_too NOT_hard , NOT_just NOT_relying NOT_on NOT_the NOT_innate NOT_charm NOT_of NOT_the NOT_leads , NOT_allowing NOT_them NOT_to NOT_build NOT_a NOT_romantic NOT_rapport . Alas , not NOT_nearly NOT_enough NOT_is NOT_built , NOT_for NOT_this NOT_moment NOT_comes NOT_to NOT_an NOT_abrupt NOT_end .

Four rooms : Starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye . Possible stars ) \" four rooms \" was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year . Key word here : \" supposed . \" Four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast . I guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great . The plot : it 's new years eve and it 's a bellboy 's first day on the job . He encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems . Tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script . It turned out each of them had written a dark comedy . Anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them . The second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot . This room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife . The third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite . The final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone 's finger . The movie was just plain trash . There was nothing NOT_here NOT_that even makes up a quality film . It was not NOT_funny , and i did n't NOT_hear NOT_one NOT_laugh NOT_in NOT_the NOT_theater NOT_throughout NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_film . Tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film . The supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors / actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals . Marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role . This movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great , perhaps like a more upbeat \" plaza suite , \" but it was n't . As trashy as it was , some people will call it classic . Do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna 's chest showing a classic film ? Look for more of ken 's kritic korner coming soon !

I am not NOT_religious and I strive to take a learner 's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that I present to my students . Betsy and Guilio Maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics ; books that I have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without NOT_bias . This particular work unfortunately is neither . Their gesture was genuine and gracious , an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote . No NOT_deity NOT_need NOT_take NOT_offense ; NOT_all NOT_were NOT_included NOT_in NOT_the NOT_pantheon NOT_of NOT_possibilities . It is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors . Though written as an overview of many of the world religions , this book culminates in a doctrinal statement of the confusing theology of religious pluralism , the view that no NOT_religion NOT_is NOT_objectively NOT_truer NOT_than NOT_any NOT_other . One point ought to be obvious , though : Everything ca n't NOT_be NOT_true . The religions mentioned are like oil and water ; they ca n't NOT_mix NOT_because NOT_they NOT_represent NOT_opposite and competing concepts . An appeal to their similarities does n't NOT_help . We would never say aspirin and arsenic are basically the same just because they both come in tablet form . It 's the differences that are critical . That 's true in all areas of life , especially the spiritual . If God exists , He 's either personal or not NOT_personal . He ca n't NOT_be NOT_both . If God is merely a cosmic energy , why ask His blessing ? He ca n't NOT_hear NOT_or NOT_respond . If He 's a person , then He 's someone , not NOT_everyone .

More than a silly - sounding mouthful to blurt out to the ticket vendor , this horror sequel 's moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot : what \" you \" did _ last _ summer \" you \" actually did the summer _ before _ last summer , and since \" i \" knew about it _ this _ summer as well as _ last _ summer , it 's really illogical to say that \" i \" _ still _ know what \" you \" did _ last _ summer . The filmmakers would have at least made sense with the shorter \" i still know , \" the longer \" i still know what you did two summers ago \" or the appropriate \" stupid people getting hacked to bits . \" That last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are the polar opposite of smart . For example , if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked and nearly murdered not NOT_long NOT_ago , NOT_would NOT_you NOT_sneak NOT_into NOT_her NOT_room NOT_late NOT_at NOT_night and hide in the closet , even if it was just to locate and borrow a cute little dress ? Probably not , but that 's precisely what college student karla ( pop diva brandy ) does to best friend julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , resulting in the first in a long line of phony frights . Julie , you 'll recall , was one of the sole survivors at the end of 1997 's surprise hit \" i know what you did last summer , \" after a slasher with a grudge to bear - it 's a _ long _ story - began trying to pick off her , her buddies and various others in their coastal carolina village . In this installment , the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas , and julie , yet racked by guilt , decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind . Yeah , right . Their island paradise has room , of course , for one more in the form of the still - alive killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . He sports the same gorton 's fisherman get - up , a heavy hat and rain slicker that mask his identity , but why he 's still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves ... Though i suppose his hook - hand would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisure suit . In a sense , that 's the movie 's glaring flaw - everybody knows who the bad guy is , thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel . The murders and attempted murders in that film were vivid and scary , but trey callaway 's derivative \" i still know \" screenplay makes the fisherman just as dumb as his pretty potential victims . When julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed , giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once and for all , what does he do ? He twist - ties the lid shut and cranks up the uv rays - you 'd think he 'd want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later . Even prequel \" summer \" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity and a few neat - o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh . The innovative gallows humor that scribe ( and \" scream \" wunderkind ) kevin williamson injected into \" i know \" 's unfolding story is sorely missed , replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weed and tosses off slang like \" yo \" ; you 'll cheer - not NOT_shriek - NOT_when NOT_he NOT_ends NOT_up NOT_with NOT_a NOT_pair NOT_of NOT_hedgetrimmers NOT_firmly NOT_implanted NOT_in NOT_his NOT_chest . If \" i know what you did last summer , \" however effective , was just the kind of movie that those subversive \" scream \" flicks poked fun at , then the deadly \" i still know what you did last summer \" deserves a full - blown roasting on \" mystery science theatre 3000 . \"", "Yeah , yeah , the advertisements did n't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex . Neve campbell and starship trooper 's denise richards getting it on ? Ok ! Yeah , it 's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that 's your main interest in this film , there 's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes . Wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however . Nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie . But this fast - paced , razor - sharp turning of events does n't NOT_leave NOT_much NOT_time NOT_to NOT_enjoy NOT_the NOT_surprises . We start off in a high - class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making . Guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts . Right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce \" mr . lombardo \" . The fund - raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor 's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you 'll be soaked from head to toe when you 're done . On the weekend of the car wash , kelly 's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day . Naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations . But the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low - class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor . Pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray . Yes , that bill murray ! Sound like a good , complete movie ? Yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning . In fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film . It is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time . By the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable . Unfortunately , with so much going on , you 're not NOT_given NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_in NOT_one NOT_predicament NOT_to NOT_be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about . This is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could 've been . The 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could 've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken . The acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime - time soap operas , which no , NOT_is NOT_not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_thing . And it 's not NOT_just NOT_campbell , NOT_who NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_hail NOT_from NOT_the NOT_prime - NOT_time NOT_fox NOT_soap \" NOT_party NOT_of NOT_five \" , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones . Dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year 's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray 's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film . In fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade . That 's how cheezy it comes off . But aside from these two , the rest offer nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_some NOT_good NOT_eye - NOT_full NOT_'s . In the right hands , wild things could 've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting . And what 's up with these people passing as high school students ? I realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it was n't NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_college NOT_they NOT_were NOT_at , NOT_i NOT_had NOT_to NOT_snicker . I wo n't NOT_lie - NOT_this NOT_is NOT_definitely NOT_a NOT_guilty NOT_pleasure . As corny as it is , it 's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a \" b \" for effort . But if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year 's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better . Of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you 'll be right at home with wild things . Perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .", "While it may have been well written , this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly .

Now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing . And guess what ? He succeeds once again !

Critique : this film is not NOT_a NOT_comedy ! NOT_It NOT_is NOT_a NOT_drama . I say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not . It is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there . Now on to my review . This movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending .

It 's no NOT_wonder NOT_that NOT_the NOT_studio NOT_is NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_sell NOT_it as a comedy ! It sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep . I 've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks . First of all , i could n't NOT_help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin . He even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit . This kept me interested in watching him at least . Number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few \" titshots \" , as they would say back in high school . And god help me if i ca n't NOT_get NOT_enough NOT_of NOT_those NOT_in NOT_an NOT_aimless NOT_drama . And three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson 's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person . A different asshole , but a different person nonetheless . If ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you wo n't NOT_throw NOT_away NOT_your NOT_hard - NOT_earned NOT_money NOT_at NOT_the NOT_theaters ? ! ) , NOT_Wait NOT_for NOT_his NOT_scene NOT_because NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_actually NOT_pretty NOT_good . Other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab . Even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while . Well , at least he finally \" came out \" and did some real skateboarding in this movie ! Oh yeah , and i guess that 's the fourth point in my rating . Anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist ... this Film 's your bag ! Otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again ... now There 's a great shrink movie ! Little known facts about this film and its stars : \" three 's company \" fans alert ! ! ! Terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film . The scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids ! Also , it is to note that the actress was once named \" penthouse pet of the month \" in march of 1976 . She was known as one joann witty back then . She 's originally from jersey . Who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ? You got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name . Jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 . He was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he 's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) . Listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the \" lost ark \" , which is obviously an in - joke , considering that it is the writer / director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co - wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) . Kasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997 's as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) .

It 's too bad because the premise of the film was interesting , but unfortunately for my friends and i , this movie turned out to be just as bad as everyone had warned us . It 's one of those films that makes you start laughing half - way through , when you realize that most of the actors in it suck , the location shots are filmed in dark \" junkyard \" type areas which they would like to have us believe to be futuristic ( whatever ... ) , and all the sets look like .... well , Sets . There is also absolutely no NOT_arc NOT_to NOT_this NOT_story . It basically starts off with keanu uploading info into his brain , and then a bunch of folks chasing him from place to place until a laughable ending puts a stop to the former uneventful proceedings .

Some other hilarities of this film include dolph lundgren as some futuristic jesus character whose supposed to kick ass , henry rollins as a pumped - up cyber - doctor or something , and ice - t as some kind of a hobo dude with paint all over his face ( do n't NOT_ask ) . The ending is the funniest with some robot dolphin and a stupid ghost - lady from inside the computer doing some stuff that no NOT_one NOT_really NOT_cares NOT_about NOT_by NOT_that NOT_point . I 'm ashamed to say this film was shot in my hometown of montreal , canada , but sadly enough for us all , it was . Some of the cyber - travelling special effects were okay ( hence , the 2/10 ) , but overall , it 's one of those bad movies that 's just funny to watch and cringe at . Thankfully for keanu , he redeemed his sci - fi career with 1999 's the matrix ( 7 . 5/10 ) . It 's too bad that he has yet to redeem his lack of acting talent .

The book already assumes a level of competence . I made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie , and the Fudgy Brownies .   All three recipes tasted delicious , so I ca n't NOT_complain NOT_there , but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes , and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much , and I even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies . I consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results , so right now I 'm wondering if I should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up .   I think it 's okay for a \" base \" cookie recipe book , but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients", "I bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new Fodor 's is n't NOT_out NOT_yet .

He and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that 's when the trouble begins . The other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) . Everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that 's curious but never compelling .

Early on , we have no NOT_idea NOT_of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves . Nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa . Later , dave is reunited with a drug - abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without NOT_any NOT_explanation . Huh ? The whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf .

But before Orwell there were Russell and Whitehead , who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence . As Whitehead wrote in his \" Foreword \" to Quine 's Ph.D. dissertation titled A System of Logic : logic shapes metaphysical thought . Thus in his \" On Universals \" Quine argued that in the Russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as \" entities \" . And he co - authored with Goodman \" Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism \" , a nominalist manifesto , in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or \" platonists \" depending on whether or not NOT_predicates NOT_are NOT_quantified NOT_so NOT_they NOT_reference NOT_entities . I believe that anyone who says that universals are \" referenced \" or who uses the phrase \" abstract entities \" fully deserves to be labeled a Platonist . But Loux uses the rhetoric from the Russellian nominalist newspeak . In the \" search inside this book \" screens at this Amazon web site the reader will find him reporting ( p. 20 ) that realists say universals are shared \" entities \" and are \" referents \" of predicates . I ask Loux : What happened to signification ? The symbolic logician Alonzo Church recognized sense ( i.e. signification ) as well as denotation ( i.e. reference ) in the functional ( i.e. predicate ) calculus . I ask Loux : What happened to supposition , which distinguishes reference from signification ? In his book titled Meaning and Necessity Rudolf Carnap explicitly affirms that intensions ( i.e. significations ) may be said to be objective without NOT_invoking NOT_any NOT_hypostatization ( NOT_i.e. NOT_reference ) , and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects . I ask Loux : Since the demise of logical positivism does the Russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else ? Is Loux trying to appear contemporary with the Russellian rhetoric ? I see murky writing . Muddled : Loux is sympathetic to Aristotle and unsympathetic to Quine , the pragmatic realist , who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism , and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing . Ontological relativity started as an analogy : Quine relativized ontology as Einstein relativized time . Einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of Newton 's absolute time , and he rejected Lorentz 's making relativistic time apparent time . Likewise Heisenberg invoked this Einstein precedent for his own realistic Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory 's positing of duality and indeterminacy . Today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition , nonlocality and Calabi - Yau spaces in eleven dimensions . Quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs . Realism is a natural , primordial , irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories . On the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial . It is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history . It is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories . But in Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic and in this book Loux rejects ontological relativity , and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity \" anti - Realism \" . In fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not NOT_oppose NOT_realism , but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change . I do not NOT_find NOT_this NOT_book NOT_contemporary . Loux 's \" Realism - anti - Realism \" locution is a false dichotomy . I see muddled thinking . Marginalized : While a student I found Notre Dame 's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism . When I left their graduate school of philosophy I took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking . I see in this book a textbook in Notre Dame metaphysics for Notre Dame philosophy students . Readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this Amazon site . Thomas J. Hicke", "Note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . Be forewarned . I was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science - fiction flick species . Squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $ 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley 's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ai n't ) . Miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they 'd dare tempt fate and go for another round . So here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . The film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . In other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there 's a catch -- he 's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who 's now infected with alien dna . Patrick 's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . And when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half - human , half - alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick 's primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . Species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey - looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . However , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not NOT_this NOT_is NOT_a NOT_cheesy NOT_b - NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_quickly NOT_answered . Mr. brancato 's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . Like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there 's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . Last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker 's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" This time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" And she 's not even empathic ! And when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully - paced suspense sequence , eve , who 's telepathically linked to her alien / human - hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien - hunting protagonists , \" he 's going to rape her . \" While species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . There 's an amusing , tongue - in - cheek bit of product placement ( which does n't NOT_really NOT_make NOT_much NOT_sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket - related hijinx ( \" he 's in aisle 1 ! \" Informs eve ) . If the film maintained this sort of light - hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects - ladened anticlimactic conclusion . Much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it 's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . The implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve 's brain ? Why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? My favourite was the slow - motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . This is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it 's being foisted upon the public . Returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there 's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . Mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all - too - familiar spin on a generic brash - mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick 's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . Mr. lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty - eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none NOT_at NOT_all ) . Ms. henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she 's so empowered . \" A lethal half - alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that 's * what i call empowerment .", "Sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking . Take this film , \" naked killer \" , among it 's ingredients are heavy doses of violence , rape sequences , straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls \" coarse language \" . But what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended ? One word - penis . That 's it . In spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is \" penis . \" . It really restores you 're faith in the system , huh ? Anyway , that 's just a side point . When naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne , it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip , cool , controversial thriller . What they forgot to mention was that it is n't NOT_very NOT_good . The plot involves male cop tinam ( simon yam ) , investigating a series of brutal murders . While getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty ( chingmy yau ) , who , after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father , falls in with professional killer sister cindy ( svenwara madoka ) . Realising kitty has potential , cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity . However in the course of his investigation tinam ( who believed kitty had disappeared ) , runs into her again , but is n't NOT_quite NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_her . To complicate matters the actual serial killlers , princess and baby , who a former students of cindy , and have been told to kill their old master and her new student . From then the action ensues ... All in all , this is not NOT_a NOT_well NOT_done NOT_movie . The script is awful , the direction all over the place , the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor . However the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain .

Eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . Dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co - writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self - proclaimed \" mission from god \" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . As we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother 's death in prison years ago . Completely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away .

Following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j. Evan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini - elwood . When bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . Meanwhile , cab 's personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next - to - next - of - kin . > from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . Those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . Only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . For those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . Appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not NOT_actors .

Be forewarned . To assess alex cox 's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . It would be derisive . It would be glib . It would be dismissive . It would be entirely accurate . Rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would - be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . The film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . The film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually can not NOT_lose NOT_at NOT_the NOT_tables . Despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . Consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . Louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip 's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip 's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise 's ex - beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father 's corpse , sans one hand . ) Meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low - rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy 's gift with the dice .

It is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past .

While tedious , the film is well - paced and does not NOT_meander , but it would be near - impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film 's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . To his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . I caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened .

Pick up some real metal .... like old Kreator .", "There 's no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_donnie NOT_brasco NOT_is NOT_based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story . But if it 's an accurate picture of life on america 's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought . For from the film 's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not NOT_unlike NOT_a NOT_number NOT_of NOT_movie NOT_lowlifes NOT_who NOT_recently NOT_gave NOT_a NOT_madonna NOT_song NOT_a NOT_close NOT_reading ) NOT_donnie NOT_brasco NOT_resembles NOT_more NOT_than NOT_passingly NOT_a NOT_few NOT_gangster NOT_flicks NOT_once NOT_believed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_works NOT_of NOT_fiction . Our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not NOT_the NOT_cheap NOT_crook NOT_he NOT_first NOT_appears NOT_to NOT_be . Brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming - up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a \" wiseguy \" . Regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well . His concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband 's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing . True , the focus on pistone 's family life does deviate from the typical gangster - flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins . The unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn - out domestic squabbles ? including an ill - advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily . The biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors . The awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 's , but not NOT_with NOT_the NOT_consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces ' costume drama casino . More importantly , pacino 's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively . Donnie brasco 's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious . Lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music . Inexplicably , lefty 's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us . It does n't NOT_any NOT_more NOT_than NOT_his NOT_family NOT_troubles NOT_do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone 's . Just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface . In these pictures pacino 's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper - capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations . Donnie brasco 's tawdry little crime , therefore is n't NOT_so NOT_much NOT_its NOT_repetition NOT_of NOT_familiar NOT_gangster NOT_themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them . ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone 's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a \" damn you mcbain ! \" I hear from springfield way ? ) So the movie is cliched . Big deal , what do you expect from a gangster - flick ? Well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre . Donnie brasco fails on both counts . The action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp 's woeful performance tends to smother the good - work of his comrades . Admittedly , pacino does nothing NOT_new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm . Depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star - struck , for he is completely hell - bent on mimicking pacino 's well - earned high style . The consequences are painful to watch . Its no NOT_exaggeration NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_the NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_credibility NOT_is NOT_seriously NOT_strained NOT_by NOT_the NOT_sight NOT_of NOT_the NOT_pistone NOT_family NOT_'s NOT_uncanny NOT_ability NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_a NOT_straight NOT_face NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_their NOT_breadwinner NOT_'s NOT_phony NOT_brooklyn NOT_accent . Perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco . Maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks . If this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america 's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes . Depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big - screen gangster greats . Who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ? But then again , perhaps donnie brasco is n't NOT_so NOT_true NOT_after NOT_all .", "Will never stay again .

The writer has a knack for making common words , like \" body , \" mind \" and \" self , \" into profound concepts .   His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies .   But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound . \t If you like poetry , Deepak may be your read : \" The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life ; ( P. 36 ) \"   Or try to interpret this one : \" The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe ; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born . ( P.40 ) \" \t At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible .

While I 'm not as excited about his Marvel work as most others are , I have enjoyed his runs on Captain America and Daredevil .   His work outside of Marvel has been great ; Sleeper is one of my favorite series over the last few years .   In general , Brubaker had not NOT_written NOT_anything NOT_that NOT_I NOT_genuinely NOT_disliked .   Then came ' Deadly Genesis' . In short , this is a weak story with several plot holes which makes a mockery of a franchise that already has a history of reworking established continuity to poor results .   To what end ?   Another Summers brother who is completely disinteresting , another story in which Professor X acts like a jerk , a dead X - Men ( for absolutely no NOT_good NOT_reason ) , and some horrible reworking of existing long running history to cram it all in which now require secrets to have been kept by several key characters for the last 30 years . I want to think that this story was driven by editorial mandate .   Unfortunately , this is the second instance in which Brubaker has went back and altered Marvel history from long ago .   In Captain America , he made it so that Bucky never really died in World War II .   This initially rubbed me the wrong way , but the story itself was done well , and the surrounding plots were good , so I begrudgingly went along for the ride .   I was still able to enjoy his entire run on the book . His attempt to revise history does n't NOT_work NOT_nearly as well here .   The key difference is that Bucky had been considered dead for so long that there was very little continuity to adjust .   He had n't NOT_been NOT_written NOT_into NOT_any NOT_stories NOT_during NOT_all NOT_that NOT_time , NOT_so NOT_it NOT_was NOT_very NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_go and insert an alternate history for him .   In ' Deadly Genesis ' , Brubaker inserts events into key storylines from 30 years ago .   In order for them to work , the reader needs to believe that several key characters has kept these events a secret from that time forward .   It just does n't NOT_work . To make matters worse , none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters ' NOT_motivation NOT_for NOT_anything NOT_makes NOT_any NOT_sense NOT_at NOT_all .   Characters are keeping secrets , and other characters are upset with that , and through the whole you never understand why .   It 's as if Brubaker had an end goal in mind , and simply crammed in any plot device necessary to get from point A to point B - even if it required characters to act contrary to their nature or the story did n't NOT_make NOT_complete NOT_sense . That aside , another difference between the two is simply that this series is not NOT_written as well as Captain America .   They overall plot does n't NOT_make NOT_complete NOT_sense and the characters are presented fairly shallowly .   Reading it was more of a chore than an act of enjoyment . The interior art is nice , though not NOT_great .

They fall in love and eventually marry . Sounds pretty good , does n't NOT_it . Well the story gets better , as eva goes on the \" rainbow tour \" across europe , trying to win respect . Eva duarte was a wonderful lady . However , all of the drama - packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood . I went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right . They only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar . Although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye - catching , as was madonna 's performance . As the \" spiritual leader of argentina , \" madonna would have definitely been an oscar - contender had she spoken a single line .

My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author 's alternative grammatical rules .   Comma splices and run - on sentences are not , and never will be , acceptable to me .   Occasional use can be overlooked , but Shaara peppers every page with them , tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject .   The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading . The following example is made - up , but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes:\"He turned in the saddle , rode toward his headquarters over the ridge , refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance , focused instead on the day ahead , forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand . \"One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run - on sentences in a row like this .   The result is a book that reads like a rough draft , or maybe not even that ;   it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft .   I do n't NOT_understand NOT_how NOT_authors NOT_get NOT_away NOT_with NOT_publishing NOT_such NOT_half - NOT_finished NOT_work , and I do n't NOT_understand why readers put up with it . Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization .   Everyone is vaguely noble here , with the exception of a few complete cads .   Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home .   Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home .   Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home .   I think you get the picture .   Few characters stand out on their own .   Even Lafayette is just another young officer .   The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book .   And Shaara 's attempts at making his characters witty never work .   The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull . Beyond that , I 'm doubtful about the author 's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter .   It 's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin 's mind .   But the rest of the time , it does n't NOT_work NOT_well .   I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus .   Either I 'm a lazy reader ( and I 'm not ) , NOT_or NOT_the NOT_device NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_working NOT_well .   In addition , this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France , and Washington , Green , Cornwallis and Howe in America .   That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England , and the continental congress in America .   In effect , this novel is really about Washington 's military camp and Howe 's dinner table , which makes the narrative unbalanced . Some aspects of the story are interesting .   I enjoy reading about Washington 's maneuvers , and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him .   I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were , and when .   But I wish now that I 'd just bought a decent beginner 's history on the war .

Apparently , no NOT_one NOT_heard NOT_my NOT_words . Oh , how i wish you had heard them . Oh how i wish someone had stopped him ... Because he 's done it again . The plot of 8 mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale . In fact , it was everything that 8 mm is not . In the opening minutes of 8 mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u. s. government . Keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves . He returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it 's important as well ) . He 's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery . After her husband 's death she comes across a film in his private safe . It appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera . The woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film . So he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film . The main problem with 8 mm is that the whole film is completely pointless . Welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman 's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) . When you first see him , your first instinct is that he 's behind the whole thing . The choice of casting does the film in . Then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him . The only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no NOT_one NOT_knows NOT_welles NOT_is even investigating anything yet . So your first instinct has now been confirmed . Then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous \" since we 're going to kill you anyway , why not NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing \" NOT_moments ) . But earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he 's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended . Huh ? Also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back . So why did he give it up in the first place ? ! The lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? ! It 's totally absurd ... And this is the screenwriter of seven ? Late in the film there 's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character 's guns ends up underneath a car . Cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table . James gandolfini 's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of \" suspense \" . You see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he 's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching . Go around to the other side of the car ! ! This goes on for minutes . Then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car . Boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves . I think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he 's seen on this case , and then is no NOT_longer NOT_able NOT_to NOT_rake NOT_his NOT_lawn ! NOT_We NOT_actually NOT_see NOT_a NOT_shot NOT_of NOT_him NOT_pathetically NOT_poking NOT_at NOT_leaves NOT_in NOT_his NOT_yard . Other things that bugged me about 8 mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that . Whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it . Awful decision there joel . Another is cage 's performance . At this point he 's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad . For 8 mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he 's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) . You 're capable of much better mr . cage . Now as for you mr . schumacher ... I 'm starting to doubt if you 're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes .

On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand , a la Keynes . What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo 's deductive , analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending . Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo . What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo . In chapter 20 of R 's book , she attempts to deal with Keynes 's theory of effective demand and Keynes 's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory . Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled & quot;The Employment Function&quot;.R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book , replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes 's chapter 20.R 's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451 - 454,directly contradicts Keynes 's analysis", "Your Taking Chances .

Turns out i was wrong , because while \" stigmata \" was merely boring and self - important , \" end of days \" is completely inept on all fronts . It 's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . For a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it 's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . For the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and \" batman & robin \" does n't NOT_count ) NOT_is NOT_no NOT_fun NOT_at NOT_all . \" end of days \" is a major stinker . The movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . Some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . If he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . The pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . In new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . Twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex - cop with a drinking problem . Now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . An assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . Recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . There are so many problems with this film it 's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? Casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . Schwarzenegger is a persona , not NOT_an NOT_actor , NOT_so NOT_putting NOT_him NOT_in NOT_a NOT_role NOT_that NOT_contradicts NOT_his NOT_usual NOT_strong NOT_personality NOT_is NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_idea . Arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . In other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . Harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they 've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not NOT_schwarzenegger . There are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho 's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine 's location by offering him his old life back . None NOT_of NOT_these NOT_scenes NOT_really NOT_work , NOT_because NOT_arnie NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_task . The filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . This one is n't NOT_at NOT_all NOT_believable NOT_the NOT_way NOT_arnold NOT_plays NOT_him . The supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . As the prince of darkness , he 's suave and confident . He acts like one would expect the devil to act . The problem is that the script has him doing things that make no NOT_sense ( NOT_more NOT_on NOT_that NOT_later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . Byrne out - performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . Byrne 's speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold 's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" ' tis not ! \" NOT_Variety ) NOT_are NOT_feeble NOT_at NOT_best . The only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . Kevin pollack plays jericho 's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . Robin tunney is n't NOT_given NOT_much NOT_to NOT_do NOT_except NOT_look NOT_scared . In fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , NOT_save NOT_for NOT_byrne , NOT_is NOT_given NOT_anything NOT_interesting NOT_to NOT_do . Performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no NOT_matter NOT_who NOT_starred NOT_in NOT_it . This being an action blockbuster , it 's no NOT_surprise NOT_that NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_thing NOT_about NOT_it NOT_is NOT_the NOT_script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_it NOT_is ) , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_utterly NOT_ridiculous . Why is the devil coming on new year 's eve , 1999 ? Because it 's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which is n't NOT_666 , NOT_it NOT_turns NOT_out . Some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you 've got 1999 ! If you do n't NOT_buy NOT_this NOT_explanation , NOT_you NOT_'re NOT_not NOT_alone . It 's convoluted and silly at the same time . The method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she 's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . . . ) , and if that were n't NOT_bad NOT_enough , NOT_there NOT_'s NOT_plenty NOT_of NOT_bothersome NOT_stuff NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_that NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_explained NOT_at NOT_all . Why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex - cop , he 's powerless ? Is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? How come he ca n't NOT_control NOT_jericho NOT_or NOT_christine ? NOT_And NOT_how NOT_did NOT_those NOT_gregorian NOT_monks NOT_deal NOT_with NOT_time NOT_zones NOT_in NOT_their NOT_prophecies ? NOT_A NOT_clumsy NOT_attempt NOT_at NOT_a NOT_joke NOT_is NOT_made NOT_about NOT_this , but it 's never actually explained . Usually , this sort of thing would n't NOT_matter NOT_in NOT_a NOT_schwarzenegger NOT_flick ( NOT_i NOT_mean , NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_started NOT_on NOT_the NOT_time NOT_paradoxes NOT_offered NOT_up NOT_by NOT_the NOT_terminator NOT_movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . There are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not NOT_that NOT_we NOT_ever NOT_find NOT_out NOT_what NOT_the NOT_cat NOT_was NOT_doing NOT_in NOT_there . It gets so formulaic that it 's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . Their predictions will rarely be wrong . The more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we do n't NOT_care NOT_about NOT_these NOT_characters ( NOT_due NOT_to NOT_the NOT_script NOT_'s NOT_pathetic NOT_attempts NOT_at NOT_characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , do n't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_sense . There 's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . It 's good for a few chuckles , but not NOT_much NOT_else . Supposedly we 're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . None NOT_of NOT_this NOT_is NOT_terribly NOT_exciting , NOT_because NOT_all NOT_the NOT_action NOT_sequences NOT_are NOT_so NOT_badly NOT_framed NOT_that NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_often NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_tell why it 's happening in the first place , not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_that NOT_they NOT_'re NOT_edited NOT_in NOT_full - NOT_on NOT_incomprehensible NOT_mtv NOT_quick - NOT_cut NOT_style . Most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \" end of days \" is not NOT_only NOT_silly and confusing , but it 's also distinctly unpleasant to watch . The devil apparently does n't NOT_operate NOT_in NOT_the NOT_more NOT_subtle , NOT_i'll - NOT_convince - NOT_people - NOT_to - NOT_kill - NOT_each - NOT_other NOT_fashion NOT_outlined NOT_in NOT_the NOT_bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . This does n't NOT_only NOT_make NOT_him NOT_an NOT_awfully NOT_predictable NOT_sort , but it also means that not NOT_a NOT_single NOT_scene NOT_in \" NOT_end NOT_of NOT_days \" NOT_goes NOT_by NOT_without NOT_unnecessarily NOT_graphic NOT_violence , NOT_or NOT_the NOT_odd NOT_kinky NOT_sexual NOT_encounter ( NOT_yet NOT_another NOT_bit NOT_that NOT_had NOT_me NOT_scratching NOT_my NOT_head ) . If violence is supposed to be shocking , it 's not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_idea NOT_to NOT_throw NOT_so NOT_much NOT_of NOT_it NOT_into NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_that NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_goes NOT_numb . Scenes are n't NOT_connected NOT_through NOT_any NOT_reasonable NOT_means , NOT_so NOT_a NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_the NOT_time , NOT_stuff NOT_gets NOT_blown NOT_up , NOT_or NOT_people NOT_get NOT_killed , and i had no NOT_idea why . Reasons ? To hell with reasons ! Let 's just blow stuff up ! Is n't NOT_it NOT_cool ? NOT_Nope , NOT_not NOT_by NOT_a NOT_long NOT_shot . This film is thoroughly unwatchable . It 's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . Perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it 's not NOT_happening NOT_with NOT_hack NOT_peter NOT_hyams NOT_here . \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it did n't NOT_top NOT_itself NOT_off NOT_with NOT_an NOT_overly NOT_pious NOT_ending NOT_that NOT_nobody NOT_'s NOT_going NOT_to NOT_buy . If the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . If it 's going to be campy , arnold should n't NOT_be NOT_taking NOT_himself NOT_so NOT_damn NOT_seriously ( NOT_i NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_actually NOT_see NOT_him NOT_put NOT_up NOT_on NOT_a NOT_cross , NOT_did NOT_i ? ) , and his character should n't NOT_be NOT_such NOT_a NOT_sad NOT_sack .

Back then , impossibly wealthy scions of society , with too much free time , would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts of sexual peccadilloes with spouses and lovers , only to have everything come out all right in the end - see \" the philadelphia story \" for a great farce . \" town & country \" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists with too much free time - the kind of people that have jobs but never seem to work - and sexual misconduct on several levels .

Porter tries to get control of his life before it is too late , but like a man fighting against quicksand , his struggle just sinks him deeper .

Warren beatty wanders around with his character in a bewildered fog , making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head . Keaton 's ellie is an empty headed flake who ca n't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_obvious as porter screws around on her . And , as you get to know them , who would want friends like griffin and mona ? The supporting cast is given nothing NOT_to NOT_do and , sometimes , does harm to the film , given the material they are forced to use . Nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling . The actress , who has , eerily , failed to age over the years , is miscast as the air - headed musician and the character does n't NOT_belong , NOT_anyway . Jenna elfman is a sweet , but smart , ditz who joins porter and griffin on one of their tacked on misadventures . Andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress ( is there any other kind in this movie ? ) Who comes on to porter .

Being and Time is chock full of invented terminology , to the extent that Michael Inwood was able to profit from his publication of A Heidegger Dictionary .

This is the case with his entire vocabulary . If there was any need for all of the inventions and distinctions made by Heidegger , I would not NOT_bring NOT_this NOT_up as a crticism . Beyond the unventilated , severely sober , and utterly uninspiring character of Being in Time , I also call attention to the futility of it 's project . If Heidegger was right about the historical neglect toward the question of being , perhaps more than 2000 years of historical peoples have been aware of something that eluded him : that there is no NOT_question NOT_of NOT_being . Why is \" the question of being \" so problematic ? Because it is unanswerable , maybe . Or if it is answerable , we 're not NOT_in NOT_any NOT_position NOT_to NOT_answer NOT_it . \" Being \" implies some kind of unvarying stability that just does n't NOT_make NOT_sense . And if you posit an idea that is so concrete , so constant , you ca n't NOT_just NOT_bend NOT_it NOT_to NOT_make NOT_it NOT_fit NOT_reality . You 've already betrayed your questioning . Truth , including the truth of being , is a local phenomenon . Truth is not NOT_always and forever true - it 's true when it 's true . But Heidegger wanted an everlasting truth , a dogmatic anthropology .

Paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie . Mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role is n't NOT_meaty NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_show NOT_all NOT_his NOT_talent . Which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does . However , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside . Also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective . Again , it 's not NOT_a NOT_character NOT_we NOT_'re NOT_seeing NOT_on NOT_the NOT_screen , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_david NOT_suchet . The director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom - in 's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting . However , looks ca n't NOT_save NOT_this NOT_film NOT_from NOT_the NOT_depths NOT_of NOT_mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway . The screenplay is o. k , but there 's some hackneyed sub - plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched . The characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel . With a combination of no NOT_tension , NOT_drama , NOT_or NOT_decent NOT_characters , NOT_a NOT_perfect NOT_murder NOT_is NOT_a NOT_failure NOT_all NOT_round , and an incredible disappointment . There are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between . The last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely NOT_manages NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_your NOT_interest NOT_thanks NOT_to NOT_michael NOT_douglas , NOT_you NOT_would NOT_n't NOT_be NOT_missing NOT_anything NOT_if NOT_you NOT_decided NOT_not NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_a NOT_perfect NOT_murder . Overall rating= Review by david wilcock ? 1998 \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes", "A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book !   I wanted to strangle him !   Repetitive , condescending , overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring ! ! !   Here is the nuts of it all :   Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask .   Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away .   Everything else is simply preamble ... over and over and over .   Hope I saved you 20 bucks", "It was a mistake to buy it . Only few pages were interestin", "This book was given to me by my cousin who thought I might find faith after hearing the eulogy I gave at my father 's funeral a year ago , in which I professed that I do not NOT_know NOT_if NOT_there NOT_is NOT_a NOT_God NOT_or NOT_not , but that the best we can do is be good people . I am agnostic , in that I am fully aware that there is no NOT_factual NOT_evidence NOT_that NOT_God NOT_exists and that there is no NOT_evidence NOT_that NOT_God NOT_does NOT_not NOT_exist . To be clear - if there was , I am pretty sure it would be widely publicized . The gift was a loving gesture and I am sincerely appreciative of it . However , I have several issues with the book . More than I can possibly iterate at this point . This book does not even mention agnosticism . As the author was educated at Yale , I am sure he must be aware of agnosticism and chose to omit it from his book . I can only presume that it was omitted with a reason , perhaps it was too hard to explain in the face of his assertion that there is evidence for God ( see below - all circumstantial and requiring leaps of faith).Without getting into too many specifics , the evidence he uses in the Case for Faith comes from obviously Christian sources - which are surely biased . This is equivalent to reporting on terrorist acts by only interviewing terrorists . Certainly one 's reporting would be validating reasons for such atrocities . To be clear I am only drawing this distinction to make the point - a true investigative reporter would look to include both sides of the story and present facts as opposed to opinion . Had Strobel intended to provide a balanced view , he would have used non - christian scientists and believers of various faiths . Strobel 's statements portend to be fact , but are generally lacking any actual evidence and in some cases are easily determined to be incorrect . A couple of examples are 1 ) His statement that Buddhism says there is no NOT_God ( NOT_various NOT_sects NOT_of NOT_Buddhism NOT_believe NOT_in NOT_gods , NOT_state NOT_there NOT_is NOT_no NOT_Creator NOT_God NOT_or NOT_do NOT_not NOT_take NOT_a NOT_stand NOT_on NOT_the NOT_matter ) and 2 ) His statements on lack of evidence for evolution - specifically macroevolution ( which is fairly well supported by actual evidence and observation - and believed to be accurate by 99 % of biologists ) .   Regarding evolution , there is actually evidence for macroevolution - although he claims there is none . This is where I have serious problems with the book . In my opinion , the book is more for current believers who need / desire to strengthen their faith , which I believe is a good thing . However , his information lacks factual support and evidence , which to me is a bad thing . I believe that most of the people who would read it would not NOT_get NOT_to NOT_the NOT_point NOT_of NOT_questioning NOT_the NOT_information NOT_in NOT_it . If one were to question it , one could easily find their faith destroyed if the information one held to be true ( and which subsequently was the basis for faith ) is found to be false . He states that there is evidence for intelligent design ; however the evidence he offers is only theory in the colloquial sense - i.e. a guess . The Theory of evolution is a theory in the scientific sense - i.e. supported by on observation and evidence . Another example is when Strobel quotes \" ... when it comes right down to it , the only person or thing I know of worth my faith - the only one supported by the evidence of history and archaeology and literature and experience - is Jesus . \" The Buddha ( meaning one who is awake ) , or    Siddhartha Gautama ( his real name ) , was an actual person , supported by all of the above listed proof of Jesus . Mohammad was also an actual person supported by all of the above . His 3 reasons for disbelief in reincarnation ( for regular people ) : 1 ) If James loses 3 pounds , he is still James , if he becomes a grasshopper he is not NOT_James - NOT_because NOT_he NOT_is NOT_not NOT_human2 ) NOT_Support NOT_for NOT_past NOT_lives - NOT_such as memories , are explainable by psychological explanations , lucky guesses , or demonic possession3 ) The only expert on this question , Jesus of Nazareth , said it does n't NOT_happen . To respond:1 ) \t To believe in resurrection , one must believe that there is a substance which makes us who we are that is not NOT_tied NOT_to NOT_our NOT_earthly NOT_form . It is not NOT_tied NOT_to NOT_being NOT_human , but to existing.2 ) \t How do you discount the possibility that reincarnation exists by asserting that demon possession exists - there is factual evidence for neither.3 ) \t To be in line with this reason , one must already accept the divinity of Jesus and that the resurrection actually happened . His arguments for the truth of the resurrection ( below ) are weak and offer no NOT_support NOT_for NOT_the NOT_fact , NOT_only NOT_that NOT_people NOT_claimed NOT_it NOT_happened . We should not NOT_confuse NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_Jesus NOT_existed NOT_with NOT_the NOT_belief NOT_that NOT_he NOT_was NOT_the NOT_son NOT_of NOT_God and specifically that he was reincarnated . Here are his proof that God exists : 1 ) \t God makes sense of the Universe 's origin2 ) \t God makes sense of the universe 's complexity3 ) \t God makes sense of moral values ( his argument is - if there are absolute moral values then God must exists God makes sense of the resurrection ( see proof below).4 ) \t God can be immediately experienced . To respond:1 ) \t Theories can be used to explain phenomenon that correlate to reality , but are not NOT_truly NOT_an NOT_explanation NOT_of NOT_reality . One still must take a leap of faith to believe his assertion . While it may explain questions about the universe - how do we know it to be accurate ? Put another way , there are other explanations that could wrap up the universe - additionally , one presumes he is speaking of the Christian God and discounting other belief systems.2 ) \t See my first objection . Same point.3 ) \t Science believes in hard observable facts being the basis for making assertions . The basis of scientific fact is that it is able to be recreated by anyone . To take the leap from the fact that there are widely accepted truths to being proof of God requires faith . He gives examples of ideas that most of the civilized world thinks are wrong , and uses them as the basis for absolute moral values . He omits that moral values have changed over time and are evolving . While I do believe that things are wrong , one can easily recognize that they are not NOT_always NOT_absolute ... for example , it is not NOT_ok NOT_to NOT_kill , NOT_unless NOT_you NOT_are NOT_in NOT_danger - NOT_or NOT_the NOT_other NOT_person NOT_killed NOT_others ( NOT_presuming NOT_you NOT_believe NOT_in NOT_capital NOT_punishment).4 ) NOT_\t NOT_His NOT_example NOT_here NOT_is NOT_that NOT_you NOT_can NOT_not NOT_prove NOT_the NOT_world NOT_exists ... fair enough , but one can prove there are universally experienced events that we can demonstrate over and over again . For example , we can do a physics experiment and everyone involved will see the same results ( barring psychological conditions ) . While we may not NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_prove NOT_that NOT_the NOT_world NOT_exists , NOT_we NOT_can NOT_confirm NOT_common NOT_experience , which is essentially what the world is ... the ground on which we all interact - whether or not NOT_that NOT_is NOT_created NOT_in NOT_the NOT_mind ( NOT_the NOT_example NOT_he NOT_gives NOT_for NOT_how NOT_the NOT_world NOT_may NOT_not NOT_exist NOT_is NOT_that NOT_all NOT_of NOT_the NOT_world NOT_may NOT_only NOT_be NOT_in NOT_our NOT_mind).Proof NOT_Jesus NOT_was NOT_resurrected : NOT_1 ) NOT_\t NOT_The NOT_location NOT_of NOT_Jesus ' NOT_burial NOT_was NOT_widely NOT_known and agreed on.2 ) \t The Sunday after his crucifixion the tomb was empty , which is agreed upon by many ( or all).3 ) \t Various groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive again.4 ) \t The original disciples suddenly and sincerely believe that Jesus was risen from the dead - even enough to die for this belief .   To respond:1 ) \t This is fact and Jesus did exist . Not NOT_sure NOT_how NOT_it NOT_relates NOT_to NOT_his NOT_divinity.2 ) NOT_\t NOT_This NOT_could NOT_be NOT_explained NOT_in NOT_several NOT_ways , NOT_hard NOT_to NOT_use NOT_this as proof of his divinity . One can suppose it is , but it takes a leap of faith - this book is supposed to explain how to have faith - but continually requests we make leaps of faith.3 ) \t Writings of people who claims to experience Jesus can hardly NOT_be NOT_taken as fact . Other religious text would claim the same about their prophets , gods , etc . 4 ) \t The disciples had a vested interest in proclaiming the divinity of Jesus . This is not NOT_actual NOT_evidence . This is equivalent to stating that the bible is true because it says it is true . Additionally , Strobel chooses which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical . In dealing with \" Objection 5 \" Strobel notes that the descriptions of Hell in the bible are metaphorical . It is hard to discern how someone can pick and choose which parts of the bible are literal and which are metaphorical . It is convenient to do so when your explanations support your understanding . I am not NOT_sure NOT_how NOT_you NOT_justify NOT_doing NOT_this . He states that only one religion can be right or God is schizophrenic . One supposes his assertion is that Christianity is the one true religion or God is schizophrenic . This again is a leap of faith . One must also presume that the various religions are not NOT_human NOT_error NOT_in NOT_interpreting NOT_God NOT_'s NOT_message . My stand is this , we do not NOT_know , and to have faith is great , however by creating a context in which one can have faith by providing erroneous and undeniably false / biased information , a false faith is created . Faith should be born out of one 's desire and belief system . One should not NOT_need NOT_to NOT_discount NOT_others NOT_because NOT_of NOT_their NOT_faith . To me , doing so indicates weakness in their faith - not NOT_strength .", "Just listening to the samples of this new remix of \" GOLD:35th Anniversary Edition ~ The Carpenters \" I found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly . Certainly not NOT_a NOT_tribute NOT_to NOT_the NOT_excellent NOT_talent NOT_Of NOT_Karen NOT_Carpenter and Richard as well . I wonder what Richard was thinking when he remixed these songs ? As another review noticed and I agree with , is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of Karen 's deep resounding truly perfect voice . This is not NOT_a NOT_CD NOT_you NOT_want NOT_to NOT_get NOT_if NOT_you NOT_really NOT_want NOT_to NOT_appreciate NOT_the NOT_true NOT_pure NOT_sound NOT_of NOT_The NOT_Carpenters . The older CDs ( if still in production or if you can find them used ) \" Carpenters Classics 25th Anniversary \" a 2 CD disc 98:04 minute Collection remastered digitally , is a much better pick . Especially for those who remember The Carpenters when Karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing NOT_to NOT_mess NOT_with . The other CD 's worth finding of The Carpendters especially if you like the Talent of Karen 's deep resounding perfect voice , would be The CD \" Voice Of The Heart \" This is a hautingly beautiful collection of Love songs by Karen who lets each song touch your Heart and Soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song . The other one I would highly recommend , if Christmas is your Holiday , would be \" Carpenters Christmas Portrait \" ... \" Special Edition digital version .... Celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the Seasons best ... \" with Karen and Richard . There are 34 Carpenters songs as timeless as their sound , and 11 performances heard on this Holiday CD for the first time . These CDs are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard Karen sing . These are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and Richard . This new remix maybe OK if you have not NOT_been NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_how NOT_wonderful NOT_the NOT_original NOT_songs NOT_The NOT_Carpenter NOT_'s NOT_recorded and later remastered - Not NOT_Remixed- NOT_sounded . For this reason I give this 35th Anniversary remix a 2 star rating . These older CDs are how The Carpenders really won over their fans , took the Music Industry by storm and gave a generation of Music lovers reason to Love The Carpenders music and the sound they gave each song . Talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only The Carpenters could deliver .

I read this book prior to a week - long trip to Venice .   This book quite simply accomplished none NOT_of NOT_its NOT_objectives .   It is a poor & quot;guidebook&quot ; and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue .   The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres .   The only upside is that it is short .   Yuck , what a waste of time .   My advice is :   get a novel about Venice if you like novels , a guidebook if you want that , an art book , or a history book .   At least you 'll get something out of those -- this one tries all of these and fails .

Things start out strong enough , with cinematographer darius khondji 's stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town during a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat .

This being a thriller , we know that she is , in fact , on the money , and it 's a credit to bening 's acting that she delves equally into claire 's madness and compassion . But as soon as a body turns up and claire has given the authorities reason enough to believe her claims , \" in dreams \" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to make sense .

In obtaining a bachelor 's degree in English , I had to read a lot of books . Among them were many books that I did not NOT_like , but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety . Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along . People become pregnant , have abortions , and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens . This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing . The book does n't NOT_flow NOT_naturally , NOT_you NOT_can NOT_virtually NOT_see NOT_the NOT_author NOT_hiding NOT_in NOT_the NOT_shadows , NOT_playing NOT_the NOT_puppet NOT_master . There are just so many coincidences , so many old friends just happening to run into eachother , so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly , all of the characters vaguely , distantly connected to eachother . I do n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_spoil NOT_the NOT_plot , but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames ( rhymes with screams ) family is just too much coincidence to bear . It 's as though the author is God , and the characters completely lack free will . And then there 's the \" protagonist , \" Homer Wells . I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story , Homer Wells barely NOT_does NOT_anything NOT_in NOT_the NOT_story . He barely even speaks during the story . He is virtually a non - character , devoid of personality or will , around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve . The scenes that do not NOT_involve NOT_Homer NOT_Wells NOT_at NOT_all , and they make up the majority of the book , are without NOT_fail NOT_the NOT_most NOT_interesting NOT_scenes . I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch , but even Melony seems more real than Homer does . The story is very long and rambling . Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on . Minor characters keep popping into the story , then disappearing , only to pop back into the story exactly when they 're needed . Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten ( like the situation with Debra Pettigrew ) . After such a rambling , at times rather boring plot , the ending feels rather rushed . It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything , tie up every loose end , in the last 25 pages ( and tying up loose ends , in this case , means a lot of people conveniently dying ) . To spoil the plot just a little , Homer Wells , who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul , suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion . I personally am pro - choice as well , but I found that Homer 's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily - ever - afters", "The ads make \" hanging up \" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters . Anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed . All of the movie 's funny scenes were included in the ad . So what do we get ? Eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital . Once upon a time , lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now - estranged wife . His one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne , who gave him a giant bullet - shaped trophy . Now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly . Eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them . Both are slow to show concern . So devoted eve stands vigil over her father , who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia , while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) . ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . ) The tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve 's events where georgia is the keynote speaker . There 's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare 's \" king lear \" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life . Sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team . Henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including \" desk set \" and \" there 's no NOT_business NOT_like NOT_show NOT_business . \" ( delia 's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) . Surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic 's wet dream . The virtue of a semi - autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available . Yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters . Also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial .

Georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile . When we first meet maddy , she 's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream . I expected to see the credit \" cinematography by ' vanity fair . ' \" And , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow 's mother . To her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off . The one redeeming aspect of \" hanging up \" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings . There 's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant . My wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine . ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not NOT_be NOT_fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) .

What Hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of Howard Zinn . He has an axe to grind , and by the end Alexander Hamilton is the devil incarnate , and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the American Revolution to its necessary conclusion . The accusation that Hogeland comes back to again and again is that Hamilton incited the rebellion . The argument is that because Hamilton 's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen 's resistance , and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion . The problem with Hogeland 's argument is his scholarship , or lack there of . He almost never offers a direct quote , especially when accusing Hamilton of malfeasance . Instead , Hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote . The reader is expected to accept on faith the author 's interpretation at face value with no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_check NOT_the NOT_facts NOT_except NOT_a NOT_ridiculously NOT_useless NOT_bibliographic NOT_essay NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end . Not NOT_all NOT_of NOT_this NOT_is NOT_Hogeland NOT_'s NOT_fault . The new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting , opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop . Even Doris Kearns Goodwin , a legitimate scholar , is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze . Ultimately , this is the main problem with William Hogeland : he is not NOT_a NOT_scholar . He is a magazine writer with an agenda , and no NOT_scholarly NOT_background NOT_to NOT_legitimize NOT_his NOT_preposterous NOT_conclusions . To read some radical agenda into the actions of the Pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history , because there is no NOT_basis NOT_in NOT_reality .", "I can tell you first hand how Amazon makes easy money .

However , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . However , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . However , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . So , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt .

Now before you go assuming i 'm some sort of high brow snob , who ca n't NOT_appreciate NOT_a NOT_little NOT_dumb NOT_humor , NOT_let NOT_me NOT_say NOT_that NOT_i NOT_love NOT_cheap NOT_humor . I thought there 's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 . Low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no NOT_humor NOT_component . I wanted to like the waterboy , i really did . I think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie . Actually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that . Not NOT_a NOT_great NOT_record NOT_for NOT_a NOT_90-minute NOT_film . The problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies . Those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material . Nothing NOT_could NOT_be NOT_further NOT_from NOT_the NOT_truth , as matter of fact , sandler 's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film . It 's really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny . I personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it 's just that so far he has n't NOT_been NOT_able NOT_to NOT_find NOT_the NOT_right NOT_film NOT_to NOT_showcase NOT_his NOT_talents . If his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live . Most of whom are now happily no NOT_longer NOT_in NOT_the NOT_entertainment NOT_industry . Sandler plays a 31-year - old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team . The team 's somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent - up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field . You can figure out the rest from here . Sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star . As i said , the film had a great deal of potential . The idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast . All of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material . Even sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material . Even as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film . But it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about . If their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie . Fairuza balk plays sandler 's leather - wearing biker - chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time . Winkler is great as the coach who uses a \" coaching for dummies \" -style book to help him get through games . The real standout though , is kathy bates . Even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler 's overprotective and overbearing mama . Even with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no NOT_way NOT_i NOT_would NOT_recommend NOT_this NOT_movie . Although i get the distinct impression that without NOT_them , NOT_this NOT_film NOT_would NOT_have NOT_ranked NOT_in NOT_negative NOT_numbers NOT_for NOT_me .

The film begins amusingly enough , with a cheeky 007-esque title sequence in which the british quintet-- \" scary \" ( melanie brown ) , \" baby \" ( emma bunton ) , \" sporty \" ( melanie chisolm ) , \" ginger \" ( geri halliwell ) , and \" posh \" ( victoria adams ) --are introduced one by one ( to , much to my surprise , excited and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience ) as they croon the silky ballad \" too much \" ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual james bond film ) . A few minutes and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london 's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film producer ( george wendt ) and a screenwriter ( mark mckinney ) pitch various film ideas to the girls ' manager , clifford ( richard e. grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentary film crew follows the girls ; ( 4 ) a pregnant \" mate \" ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidly approaches her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publisher ( barry humphries ) attempts to destroy the group with the help of a sneaky shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . Capped off by a live rendition of the girls ' bouncy hit \" say you 'll be there , \" a wealth of laughs and merriment is sure to follow , right ? Wrong . it 's all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches . I must give the girls credit for their refreshing willingness to make fun of themselves , but writer kim fuller and director bob spiers can barely NOT_come NOT_up NOT_with NOT_a NOT_funny NOT_joke NOT_between NOT_them , NOT_much NOT_less NOT_a NOT_organized NOT_framework NOT_for NOT_all NOT_the \" NOT_wacky \" NOT_goings - NOT_on . Spice world jumps from vignette to vignette , subplot to subplot with no NOT_direction and little sense , at one minute having the girls meet with aliens ( no NOT_joke ) and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall into the water during a boat ride . While a decent joke slips through the cracks here and there -- during a \" dance bootcamp \" scene , the girls sing the lyric \" we know how we got this far / strength and courage and a wonderbra \" --much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level . Some gags are just plain pointless , such as roger moore 's recurring role as the mysterious chief , who dispenses cryptic , metaphor - heavy advice to clifford . The only reason why i can think anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond . Ha ha . As weak as the script is , i think there 's one insurmountable problem with even attempting to make a spice girls movie , and that is the girls themselves . The point is not NOT_that NOT_they NOT_ca NOT_n't NOT_act ( and , for the record , they really _ ca n't _ ) but that their individual personas , which works as a gimmick over the span of a four - minute music video , are too thin to survive outside of the truncated , video bite mtv world . Posh ( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions ) comes off best by default because her persona ( rich bitch ) most easily translates into character in a film . Baby 's persona ( young innocent ) , to a lesser extent , also works , but the remaining girls ' identities are a little harder to flesh out . There really is n't NOT_much NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_sporty NOT_besides NOT_having NOT_her NOT_exercise NOT_every NOT_so NOT_often ( which is _ exactly _ what fuller and spiers do ) , and , after all , what exactly entails being \" ginger \" or \" scary \" ? Apparently , just their wardrobes . Spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices ' signature hit , \" wannabe . \" The song is as grating as ever , but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much - needed shot in the arm , setting the stage for a wave of self - referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters ' film ideas ( the film almost mirrors robert altman 's the player in the way the film snails into itself ) . This section of the film , involving all manner of derring - do involving a speeding bus , is perhaps its most effective , but it also points up how all the other storylines ( the publisher , the documentary crew ) lack a satisfactory payoff . Spice world is harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family , and it will please the spice faithful . But this sloppy enterprise surely wo n't NOT_win NOT_them NOT_any NOT_new NOT_fans , which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl power in the states .

This , of course , will be of no NOT_service NOT_to NOT_your NOT_readers , but at least you 'll avoid the hate mail from the movie 's fans .

Directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez .

The acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie . Grainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16 mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it . Confusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story . Quite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us . Why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year - old paulina ? Another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her . In retaliation , she bites off part of his finger . This covers the both of them in a bucket of blood . The passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner . One , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body . The lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten . Certainly she had to endure a miserable life . But that does not NOT_guarantee NOT_that NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_about NOT_her NOT_will NOT_necessarily NOT_being NOT_good .

Not NOT_only NOT_it NOT_is NOT_poorly NOT_written , NOT_badly NOT_acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . Unfortunately , it 's not NOT_bad NOT_in NOT_the NOT_way NOT_great , NOT_colossal NOT_misfires NOT_like \" NOT_heaven NOT_'s NOT_gate \" ( NOT_1980 ) NOT_or \" NOT_ishtar \" ( NOT_1987 ) NOT_were NOT_bad . Instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . With all the good scripts lying around hollywood un - produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? Of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984 's \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981 's \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . Most of these films were just cheapie b - movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex - olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . Therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \" greystoke \" added a never - before - seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis - guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek 's bare breasts . \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing NOT_to NOT_offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . The script , by bayard johnson and j. anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . Comic books have better plots than this . The movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer 's comedy \" george of the jungle . \" Did n't NOT_the NOT_producers NOT_think NOT_to NOT_leave NOT_that NOT_back NOT_in NOT_the NOT_old NOT_weissmuller NOT_pictures NOT_where NOT_it NOT_belongs ?

When the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without NOT_an NOT_english NOT_accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . However , when a wicked archeologist / grave - robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa 's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . At first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape - man . Once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . Most of the so - called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no NOT_pace , NOT_tension , NOT_or NOT_action NOT_to NOT_speak NOT_of . There are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . When the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace - friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . The movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . For instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he does n't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi - experienced weekend backpacker would do . Instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no NOT_plan NOT_for NOT_survival . Of course , one ca n't NOT_help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . Not NOT_to NOT_ruin NOT_the NOT_ending NOT_or NOT_anything , but there is no NOT_lost NOT_city . There is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource - strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not NOT_worthy NOT_of NOT_a NOT_made - NOT_for - NOT_tv NOT_movie ) . Which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it 's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? Strictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" is n't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien 's laughably stiff performance comes real close . This movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he can not NOT_act , but he sure looks well - groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . Van dien is much too much of a pretty - boy to be an effective tarzan ; he 's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . I also wondered what the make - up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . Waddington makes a decent villain , although he 's like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex - model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . She does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . However , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . So , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short .", "I got to page 26 and gave up .   Lockes writings lack focus and are void of humour .

In his early years of film - making he mastered the simple comedy . From there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles . Some of these work better than others . Zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist . Deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back . Harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives . He wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing . The story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments . Perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry 's life by editing harry 's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out . As a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises . The film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry 's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry 's life . These fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters . It is up to the viewer to keep track not NOT_just NOT_who NOT_is NOT_fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person . If that sounds complicated , it is . Then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image . Harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time . As if these touches did not NOT_create NOT_sufficient NOT_confusion , NOT_the NOT_story NOT_is NOT_told NOT_out NOT_of NOT_chronological NOT_order . If allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable . But allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_effort NOT_to NOT_understand . Deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry 's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement . Harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him . Just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear . Harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry 's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) . Block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly 's mother , previously first harry 's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father . Another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems . Harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) . It is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different -- black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino 's character in the previous film . While the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny . The centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry . That story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry 's unwillingness to commit even to telling a story . The linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care . That character is patently not NOT_the NOT_one NOT_allen NOT_creates NOT_in NOT_harry NOT_block and not NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_around NOT_harry as seen through his acerbic eyes . Allen can do much better than deconstructing harry . I rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .", "America loves convenience . After all , we 're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control . Yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far . Ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill - poppin ' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve \" demolition \" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home . When she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed \" the commander , \" \" the rookies , \" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town 's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents ' head - chopping , alien - possessed clutches . Filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes - sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill - conceived action sequences . The only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story . Ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose . Attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced . Most of these moments come off as kwik - e - mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even - tempered streetwise hand of ice cube . With a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie - stomping fun to \" me and my brother when we was kids . \" Apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment . But , even in the film 's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite . Yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing NOT_beats NOT_a NOT_good NOT_stick NOT_of NOT_tnt . And as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand . Characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ? As long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed . Eventually though , even the most well - trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson . What better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns ca n't NOT_handle . Explosions are fun . And even if the nukes do n't NOT_get NOT_them , NOT_the NOT_conveniently NOT_placed NOT_dynamite NOT_packs NOT_on NOT_the NOT_train NOT_stolen NOT_from NOT_the NOT_set NOT_of NOT_the NOT_road NOT_warrior NOT_certainly NOT_will . In the end this film defines itself when our cop 's tribunal pronounces , \" is that all you have to tell us ? \" For , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story .", "Capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes , and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones . Basic instinct 's worst crime is that it 's not NOT_just NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_movie , but in many ways , an incompetent one as well . It 's stupid in itself , and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is . It 's supposed to be a thriller , but the plot is dead on its feet , and ultimately arbitrary ; it 's only put into the movie to jerk us around . It 's also supposed to be sexy , but it 's instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures . It 's a ripoff . The story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm . The biggest suspect is an authoress , catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) , who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged . Or maybe it 's the work of a copycat ? These and other plot threads get fed to the detective who 's on the case ( michael douglas ) , who has a few problems himself . Like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor . We can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance . Joe eszterhas has written the screenplay , and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge : the killer 's identity is kept a secret until the movie 's final shot . This is n't NOT_in NOT_itself NOT_a NOT_problem -- NOT_the NOT_problem NOT_is NOT_that NOT_up NOT_until NOT_that NOT_point , NOT_we NOT_'ve NOT_been NOT_given NOT_nothing NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with . Every clue in the movie -- every clue -- is ambiguous . The whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill . Red herrings , dead plot threads , violence , and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets . They add up to zip , because they 're not NOT_happening NOT_to NOT_people NOT_we NOT_care NOT_about . Douglas 's character is foulmouthed and bitter and that 's it ; stone 's character has an iron - on smile that never changes ; the rest are forgettable . When we do n't even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ? Especially with an ending that is not NOT_only NOT_unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ? ( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : \" if no NOT_one NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_behaves NOT_like NOT_anyone NOT_you NOT_know , NOT_or NOT_would * NOT_care * NOT_to NOT_know , NOT_just NOT_leave ! \" ) NOT_One NOT_of NOT_the NOT_nastier NOT_things NOT_about NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_the NOT_way NOT_it NOT_treats NOT_lesbianism NOT_not as an integral part of someone 's life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with .

A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia .

The concept of the book is good , as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9 - 11 tragedy . The first 20 pages flow with typical Archer style . Then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions . My personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to Canada or Mexico in order to fly to Europe during the 9 - 11 grounding of air traffic . The idea that New Yorkers would n't NOT_know NOT_that NOT_Montreal NOT_is NOT_the NOT_nearest NOT_international NOT_airport NOT_seem NOT_laughable . While there is a direct highway to Montreal , Archer sends the main character to Toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes , is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive . Once at the border , the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly does n't NOT_know NOT_that NOT_McGill NOT_University NOT_is NOT_in NOT_Montreal NOT_not NOT_Toronto as is claimed by our hero . The guard then remarks that he will \" meet \" a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference . The idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern US / Canadian border crossings , with multi - lane checkpoints 24/7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality . Its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story , but there is simply no NOT_benefit NOT_to NOT_this NOT_sillyness . Dan Cormie", "Warning : may contain slight mild spoilers . Rated : r for intense violence / gore , some strong sexuality and language . Starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne . Running time : 132 minutes We go into a movie theater , boom ! The lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we 've been waiting to see for a long time comes on . We sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is . Why should n't NOT_i NOT_have NOT_know NOT_what NOT_i NOT_was NOT_getting NOT_myself NOT_into . Again like this past summers hit \" stigmata \" , \" end of days \" may be worse . It 's not NOT_like NOT_this NOT_is NOT_any NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_original NOT_idea , NOT_it NOT_just NOT_throws NOT_in NOT_some \" NOT_rosemary NOT_'s NOT_baby \" , NOT_along NOT_with \" NOT_the NOT_devil NOT_'s NOT_advocate \" NOT_a NOT_little \" NOT_exorcist \" and some \" stigmata \" here and there . Whala you have \" end of days \" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific . Sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers . The plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next . Jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist . He has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he 's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes . He seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that 's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie . That 's pretty much it on plot . It does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100 m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went . As for arnie ? Good role , ok performance . I think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts . The thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing NOT_to NOT_the NOT_film . In the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions . Gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in \" stigmata \" ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not NOT_into NOT_his NOT_character . Two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun \" the devil 's advocate \" and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also . Robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan 's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child . Of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really is n't NOT_nothing NOT_new . The direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not NOT_nearly as the visual style was in \" stigmata \" . Here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just do n't NOT_work NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie . The script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no NOT_substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home . Only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product do n't NOT_work as well . The sad thing is that \" end of days \" had so many things going for it . The plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind - numbing . At times it seems like \" armageddon \" and started to get old and tiresome . Hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i 've always said before needs new ones . Even with its 100 m budget \" end of days \" is less than pleasing . In fact the 100 m dollar budget is at least 30 m over , and easily could have had a 70 m budget . Maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original . We need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box - office . We need to get more films like \" the blair witch project \" that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch . Overblown effects , stupid and thin plot - line , good performances , disappointing .... umm Yup those pretty much describe \" end of days \" .", "great if you 're a bat . .

Really , the only difference between him and 50 cent is content .

Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda ( I 'm sorry , I tried to like him , but dude is simply terrible ) , Big Pooh ( same goes for him ) , and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener .

My children kept asking , \" how many more pages ? \"", "It 's always a bad sign when the core audience of a film -- children -- are either walking out early or are half - asleep when the credits roll at the end of a film . That about sums up the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians , a cold pea soup of cute animals , stupid home alone antics , a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans , and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression . Indeed , walt disney is rolling over in his grave again , cursing john hughes ' name for making the original live - action 101 dalmatians , one of the worst kiddie flicks of all time , and now its sequel . The main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor , 101 dalmatians . The original made more than $ 100 million dollars at the box office , spawned a torrid collection of \" collectible \" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal - marts across the country , and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas . Well , it 's been about four years since then , and dalmatian fever is coming back , and this time it 's digitally enhanced . Here 's the story . Cruella de vil ( glenn close ) is released from prison due to the \" cure \" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr . pavlov . ( oh , how witty . ) She rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . Cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . A kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . At this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . How low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film 's villain ) sunk in the film business ? It 's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . And depardieu ... How can a french guy have a bad french accent ? And never mind the toilet brush haircut .

Directed by william malone , written by dick beebe , \" house on haunted hill \" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie - like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible . One doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck . A nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water . These mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b - horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements . Except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be . In past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not NOT_shown NOT_forcing NOT_the NOT_viewer NOT_to NOT_assume NOT_their NOT_own NOT_nasty NOT_bloody NOT_deaths NOT_for NOT_the NOT_hapless NOT_victims . \" house on haunted hill \" does n't NOT_want NOT_their NOT_audience NOT_to NOT_have NOT_an NOT_imagination , NOT_everything NOT_is NOT_provided NOT_for NOT_them NOT_to NOT_watch and squirm , not NOT_think . This nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film . \" house on haunted hill \" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest . The film has no NOT_intention NOT_of NOT_providing NOT_character NOT_development NOT_or NOT_a NOT_laudable NOT_plot . The aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem . However , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable . The plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) . Each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money . Since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not NOT_is NOT_killed NOT_five NOT_minutes NOT_after NOT_you NOT_meet NOT_them . The problem is that every character is not NOT_likable . The two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) . The characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them . The worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan 's watson pritchett . He spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself . Waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through . The most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) . Playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face . However , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen . The main problem is that \" house on haunted hill \" is not NOT_scary . To top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous . If the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to \" deep blue sea \" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed .", "I am reading this for a college course called \" History of the American City \" .

I simply hated it . On its menu for fun , is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue - and - cheek manner . It 's a serial killer / horror film farce of nonstop over - the - top action and sleaze , involving decapitations , vampires , biker fights , extended gun play , and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed . A film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood - and - gore , as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b - films . It 's geared only for the cult film crowd , and will make its mark there one way or the other . The plot involves two psychopath brothers , the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer , richie ( tarantino ) , who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist . They escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town . They have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops , they have also taken a middle - aged bank teller as a hostage . In the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk , and burn down the store . Stopping off in a flop - house motel , richie rapes and slaughters the hostage . These scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody , if that 's possible . On the tv news , it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers . The brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos ( cheech ) , who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take . With road blocks and car searches at the border , the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed . There is the father , jacob fuller ( keitel ) , who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident ; his sexy 20-year - old , innocent daughter , kate ( lewis ) ; and , her shy brother scott ( liu ) . It 's not NOT_explained NOT_how NOT_he NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_be NOT_chinese . The story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar / whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister . The place is open from dawn to dusk , thus the film 's title . Here 's where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun , as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout . It sells sex to its patrons , and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium ( hayek ) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire . The brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place , as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the film 's staple . This supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off , though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings . I 'll take a pass on this one , it 's just not NOT_my NOT_style NOT_of NOT_a NOT_film .

This is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve . As a result of this , generally , albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums . Ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album . Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album . As I mentioned before , due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums , the average score rarely falls below 3 stars . It takes a pretty horrendous album , like Limp Bizkit 's Results May Vary , to get a score of even 2.5 . In fact , I did n't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is , until I saw this pile of feces . Now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of \" hataz \" reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it . Out of all the terrible albums I have viewed , I have never seen this happen before . Not even to bands as terrible as Limp Bizkit or even An*l C*nt .

Very disappointing and slow paced", "\" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . That 's right . The major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not NOT_better . This central device is the fact that a nine - year - old boy is autistic . His name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . Simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . The fact that he is autistic does nothing NOT_for NOT_the NOT_emotional NOT_intensity NOT_or NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_necessities NOT_of \" NOT_mercury NOT_rising . \" I suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon 's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . Miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he 's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . It 's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he is n't NOT_playing NOT_like NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_autistic . Unlike dustin hoffman 's performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio 's in \" what 's eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . However , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character 's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . Hell , he does n't even have to be shy . In fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis ' arm . Willis ' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . He becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon 's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . Of course , we know that is n't NOT_the NOT_way NOT_it NOT_happened NOT_happen NOT_because NOT_we NOT_saw NOT_an NOT_evil , NOT_square - NOT_jawed NOT_government NOT_hitman NOT_with NOT_a NOT_mean - NOT_looking NOT_crew - NOT_cut NOT_knock NOT_off NOT_the NOT_parents . Simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . Jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . This is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon 's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . Late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . Of all the hard - to - believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . I can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey 's character is far too accommodating . Not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_she NOT_agree NOT_to NOT_watch NOT_simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . The grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . The movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" does n't NOT_rise NOT_to NOT_the NOT_challenge . The movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . There is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no NOT_idea NOT_1 ) NOT_exactly NOT_where NOT_they NOT_were NOT_on NOT_the NOT_streetcar , NOT_2 ) NOT_who NOT_was NOT_hitting NOT_who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . The grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not NOT_because NOT_he NOT_has NOT_to , but because it 's more suspenseful that way . Taken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . Usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . This is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . Maybe the book was better , but the way it 's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .", "It is ludicrous to even mention the fact that The Duprees have lasted so   long and can still be seen in Atlantic City considering the fact that there   is not NOT_one NOT_original NOT_member NOT_of NOT_the NOT_Duprees NOT_in NOT_the NOT_group NOT_that NOT_is NOT_seen NOT_in NOT_  NOT_Atlantic NOT_City .

In summary , it reads very much as a first effort , perhaps an experiment , but I found it baffling that anyone could consider it a mature piece of prose . G Rodgers", "Was not NOT_impressed .   Narrow scoped , personal reflections , applications limited .   I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not NOT_impressed", "This book is best used for viewing its selection of Master Drawings many of which are superb . However , its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo - intellectualizations . It should be noted that this book was not NOT_written NOT_by NOT_Hale ; NOT_it NOT_was NOT_written NOT_by NOT_one NOT_of NOT_his NOT_students and lacks the quality of Hale 's classic , \" Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters . \" Instead , this book loses itself in unimportant , erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle , confuse , frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader . It greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory", "\" jack frost , \" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching . This does not NOT_come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other . Jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle - aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year - old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but does n't NOT_spend NOT_nearly NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_with NOT_them . When he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas . Halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies . Switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack 's death . When charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack 's spirit . Jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise . \" frosty the snowman , \" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live - action film , it does n't NOT_work NOT_at NOT_all . After a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , \" jack frost , \" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play . Since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , \" what happens after you die ? \" Or , \" how does it feel to be a snowman ? \" But instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie . The performances are respectable enough , but no NOT_one NOT_deserves NOT_to NOT_be NOT_punished NOT_by NOT_appearing NOT_in NOT_a NOT_silly NOT_film NOT_like NOT_this . Michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ? I have always liked kelly preston . She is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one - dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997 's , \" nothing NOT_to NOT_lose , \" and , \" addicted to love . \" Joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent . In one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman . This brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried - and - true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son . Since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no NOT_choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe - inducing lines of dialogue . Some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : \" you da man , \" says charlie . \" no , NOT_i NOT_da NOT_snowman , \" NOT_replies NOT_jack . Or how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : \" snowdad is better than no NOT_dad . \" Do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ? The snowman , created by john henson 's creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year 's unintentionally hilarious direct - to - video horror flick , also called , \" jack frost , \" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects . Either way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project . As a seasonal holiday picture , \" jack frost , \" is pretty much a clunker . A better christmas film from this year is , \" i 'll be home for christmas . \" Better yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , \" it 's a wonderful life , \" \" a christmas story , \" or , \" prancer . \" \" jack frost , \" is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better . I doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway .", "Service below acceptable levels . I am platinum Starwood Preferred Guest member . Redeemed my starpoints and booked 4 nights in Westin Exelsior .

Some tips also for those who are to visit Rome for the first time . it is still a fantastic city . despite the high prices . - taxi from the airport is a ripp off . the moment you ask for a fixed price nobody is any longer interested . even the official taxi 's . which makes you will end up paying up to 80 to 90 Euro 's . depending on the hotel .   So you either take the express train . but more interesting is to call on a private company called M L M.   tel . 39 328 3172346 . which brings you to the centre for Eur 35 . even in a new big van with airco .   Some tips for restaurants . only few restaurants are worth the price . Few positive experiences found around the main touristic areas . I can recommend Ristorante Passetto around Piazza Navona . not NOT_cheap - NOT_you NOT_will NOT_end NOT_up NOT_with NOT_Eur NOT_100 NOT_for NOT_2 NOT_persons but food is very good .   Orso 80 . also near Piazza Navona . was a big disappointment despite strong recommendations in a previous review . I did order the veal but is was served in a watery sauce and both the mushrooms and the olives accompanying came directly out of a tin . Fantastic dining experience in Trastevere . restaurant called Glass Hosteria . very modern design interior and great ' menu d gustation ' for only Eur 30 per person comprising about 7 different dishes .

So how are they ?   Well , Satch 's voice is n't NOT_superb , but he does an ok job .   The problem really is with the material-- it 's clear he 'd gotten used to writing pieces as guitar features .   The only real exception to this in my assessment is frantic electric blues \" Big Bad Moon\"-- the piece is blazing and explosive , the vocal is passable , and Satriani is on fire .   But pieces like \" Ride \" , \" The Phone Call \" and \" Strange \" are all pretty much forgettable ( well , \" Ride \" is actually a bit too irritating to be forgettable ... ).The remainder of the material is a mix between exploratory ( and primarily acoustic ) pieces ( \" The Feeling \" ) which are nice but largley filler and \" Surfing With the Alien \" styled instrumentals ( \" One Big Rush \" , \" Back to Shalla - Bal \" ) .   The exception is the chugging opener and title track , \" Flying in a Blue Dream \" , which features Satriani at his most lyrical as a guitarist . Invariably , the album is a bit too weak for its own good-- it 's probably also a bit too long ( about 65 minutes ) and probably would have benefited from being trimmed down a bit .

If you only remember one thing about fair game , it should be that it singlehandedly proves crawford should stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues . If you thought kathy ireland was laughable in alien from l. a. , you 'll change your mind when you see fair game . Ireland would win handfuls of oscars if this was her only competition . In a real casting coup , crawford plays a super - intelligent lawyer ( in a jogging bra , of course ) . We all know this is a stretch , the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day . Nonetheless , someone out there thought she 'd make a good lawyer , but we 're reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes .

You know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them , you know when the \" sexual tension \" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship , you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movie 's going to suck from the first scene .

I HATED this hotel . Seriously . Seething hate . I stayed here on the last night of my trip to Italy which was for 2 weeks . Throughout that time I stayed in budget cheaper hotels and yet always had great . safe . clean rooms with excellent service . I payed the most for this crappy little room with horrific service . I was livid . First of all the only reason to stay at this hotel is to be near the station . If you 're leaving the next day for a flight . it is convenient .

Uncalled for . He would not even let me drop off my bags first and let me splash my face even though I told him I was exhausted .

The television never worked and the breakfast was as basic as can be The only good thing about this hotel can be summed up in 1 word - LOCATION . Do not NOT_stay NOT_at NOT_this NOT_Hotel .", "I should have known , damn it , i should have known . Ewan mcgregor - codename : \" eye \" - is pointing a high - tech rifle - ly gadget at a fat , bald business - oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street . We get the requisite electro - green through - the - sight view . We the audience , seeing a high tech rifle - ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low - quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e - mail to everyone in his target 's office . All right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle / camera , but i was still open minded ... Maybe there 's a really good reason for it . I 've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor 's previous work ... And he 's obi wan ke- friggin - nobi for god 's sake . And director stephan elliot 's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight . There 's some genuine talent involved here . I think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart . Eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization 's son ( i still have no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_this NOT_organization NOT_was - NOT_british NOT_intelligence ? NOT_National NOT_spy NOT_ring ? NOT_Private NOT_investigation ? ) , NOT_who NOT_is NOT_apparently NOT_stealing NOT_from NOT_his NOT_trust NOT_fund . He has received his assignment from k. d. Lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase . When eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard . Ok , that 's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting . Then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims \" merry christmas , dad ! \" For the first time . So begins our tale of obsession ... Or ... something . The rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor 's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar . Throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras . Fine , that 's a lovely premise , i suppose . But gosh darn it , if you 're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation . And that 's precisely where this film fails . This is the kind of movie that pisses me off . It 's an abortion , a collection of half - formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing NOT_in NOT_the NOT_end . It pretends it is something that it is not - NOT_a NOT_surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high - tech thriller . Here , the filmmakers have confused \" surreal \" and \" deep \" with \" vaguely unclear \" and \" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . \" I never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in \" love \" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people . The movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense . Explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye 's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he should n't NOT_leave NOT_ms . judd . Explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : \" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . \" Whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed . That 's as deep as it gets , folks . There is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth - grade mad lib . There are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no NOT_purpose NOT_except NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_wonder NOT_what NOT_the NOT_hell NOT_the NOT_point NOT_was . My personal favorites include : the prison - matron modeled after austin powers ' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley 's awfully played dirty desert vagrant # 1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop - who - sees - ashley - fleeing - an - accident - scene - and- then - wants - to - pay - for - sex- but - is - shot . Each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last . The script pays no NOT_attention NOT_to NOT_the NOT_laws NOT_of NOT_time and space . Any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed . Bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow - motion close - up awash in a lot of bass . Ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell . Jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally ... Cut to random guy with eye patch ... Iguana out of focus ... Iguana comes into focus . Wow , man . When i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no NOT_surprise NOT_to NOT_me . There are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story . And i would n't NOT_be NOT_surprised NOT_if NOT_i NOT_found NOT_out NOT_there NOT_was NOT_an NOT_hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director 's cut ...

The last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .

The result should have been more interesting than \" the cell . \" As the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that 's never fully explained . After months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no NOT_success NOT_to NOT_report . Meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim . His particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them . He takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning . Although carl 's been doing this for awhile , he 's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast . Not NOT_fast NOT_enough , NOT_though , NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_carl NOT_from NOT_sticking NOT_another NOT_woman ( NOT_tara NOT_subkoff ) NOT_in NOT_the NOT_cell NOT_or NOT_to NOT_catch NOT_him NOT_before NOT_he NOT_suffers NOT_a NOT_schizophrenic NOT_attack NOT_that NOT_leaves NOT_him NOT_in NOT_a NOT_coma . From the videos in carl 's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction . To save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl 's not NOT_talking . So off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl 's mind and find out where the cell is in time . The focus of \" the cell \" in on the ornate interior of carl 's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer - generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality . For the most part , it 's style without NOT_substance . In his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father . All in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast - forward to the next development . Singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem 's \" losing my religion , \" and \" the cell \" seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted . Singer lopez seems to think she 's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting . The premise had great promise . The computer - generated world within carl 's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic . The first room catharine enters in carl 's head shows this promise . She finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp - edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments . The panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still - living horse . This scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought - provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder . Another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath . Their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine 's own psyche . Like sidney lumet 's \" the offence \" or michael mann 's \" manhunter , \" \" the cell \" could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator . However , catharine 's character is hardly NOT_developed NOT_at NOT_all , and lopez has no NOT_depth NOT_to NOT_offer NOT_the NOT_role .

Because that s all that there really is .... I found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot .

NOT_But NOT_it NOT_does NOT_leave NOT_one NOT_to NOT_wonder ... i Know i did . Another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out .... And certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations . There was one scene that should have been short ... But it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking .. Ok enough already get on with it . There are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do ... Things just magically happen and there is no NOT_prelude NOT_or NOT_anything NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sort ... Another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without NOT_a NOT_trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning . This movie is also very predictable ... You can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment .. Granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you . Also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated ... It gets boring at times to tell you the truth ... Even though there is still action going on . Another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not NOT_some NOT_shoot NOT_them NOT_up NOT_type NOT_of NOT_hero . Some of the characters are not NOT_proper NOT_for NOT_their NOT_roles . The acting is fine but the characters just do n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_add NOT_up .

Another thing is the destruction scenes ... Wow , those were masterpieces .. Well some of them were they were well choreographed and along with the dino 's make this one of the reasons to see this movie . This movie is fairly long but it is action packed so it should do well in the box office .. Unfortunately it will take away from fifth element but alas what can we do ..

He has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star . After sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us - mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film . Unfortunately , his men with guns is not NOT_the NOT_film NOT_anyone NOT_was NOT_hoping NOT_for . We are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do . Then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is . The plot of men with guns can be summarized \" in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas . Dr. fuentes did not NOT_believe NOT_how NOT_bad NOT_things NOT_were NOT_so NOT_he NOT_went . And he found out again and again and again . \" Of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell . A guerrilla war is always bad for civilians . But the film talks down to the viewer . Dr. fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country . He has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios . Fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service . Then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy . In shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others . The student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not NOT_be NOT_a NOT_good NOT_place NOT_to NOT_be . Fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general . The results are little different than one would expect . Dr. fuentes starts out incredibly naive . Even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains . But fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was . Sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians . The cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences . Federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .

But as the trailer goes , \" there is one thing mitch weaver is good at -- revenge . \" So he and sam parlay their unmatched skill in getting - even schemes into a marketable revenge - for - hire business called dirty work inc . This should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy , but for a film called _ dirty_work _ , what ensues is rather clean of spirit . In fact , what makes mitch and sam start up their business is not NOT_a NOT_giddy NOT_desire NOT_to NOT_give NOT_bullies NOT_a NOT_taste NOT_of NOT_their NOT_own NOT_medicine , but rather a more sappy reason : sam 's father ( jack warden ) needs a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list , his compulsively betting doctor ( chevy chase ) asks the guys for $ 50 , 000 to pay off his bookie .

There are frequent sexual references , most prominently in the form of prostitutes and sam 's impotent father 's ongoing lust for them . And for a film rated pg-13 , director bob saget ( yes , that bob saget , of _ full_house _ and _ america's_funniest_home_videos _ fame ) and writers frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundaries of good taste rather far -- arguably a bit too much so ( was not NOT_one , but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary ? ) . But the issue , of course , is not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_of NOT_taste as it is humor -- as in , is it funny or not ? NOT_The NOT_answer NOT_is NOT_a NOT_resounding NOT_no .

Still , macdonald 's few shining moments are just about the only moments the film has . The late chris farley , as hysterical as he ever was , is amusing in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the supporting players are amateurish and seemingly free from any directorial guidance .

Right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with . Eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean - luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment . Meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she did n't NOT_commit and returns to her ex - boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .

I liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again . These bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by - the - numbers .

In the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone 's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better . Although not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_her NOT_better NOT_turns , NOT_stone NOT_does NOT_have NOT_a NOT_comic NOT_flare NOT_that NOT_refuses NOT_to NOT_be NOT_ignored . Jean - luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag . All other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none NOT_more NOT_than NOT_cathy NOT_moriarty , NOT_an NOT_entertaining NOT_actress NOT_in NOT_her NOT_own NOT_right , NOT_who NOT_is NOT_billed NOT_fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria 's friend whom she turns to for help . Sony , the studio that released \" gloria , \" obviously does not NOT_have NOT_any NOT_faith NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film , and i do n't NOT_blame NOT_them . They declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high - profile people involved . Although how much money a movie makes does not NOT_determine NOT_how NOT_good NOT_it NOT_is ( NOT_just NOT_look NOT_at NOT_the NOT_spectacular \" NOT_in NOT_dreams , \" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion \" gloria \" is going to vanish from theaters faster than \" ishtar , \" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p. m. showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself . Although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995 's \" casino \" or 1996 's \" last dance \" if you do n't NOT_believe NOT_me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no NOT_reasoning NOT_for why they thought the cliched story of \" gloria \" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .", "This book should get 0 stars ; speaking as an artist myself , the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous . The basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without NOT_the NOT_use NOT_of NOT_optics , NOT_etc . To me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not NOT_have NOT_either NOT_the NOT_talent NOT_or NOT_the NOT_determination NOT_to NOT_attain NOT_the NOT_skill NOT_of NOT_a NOT_great NOT_master , and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse . Admittedly , I could not even finish this book ; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky , circumstantial evidence like \" all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw , but there are no NOT_correction NOT_marks , NOT_therefore NOT_optics NOT_must NOT_have NOT_been NOT_used , \" NOT_I NOT_could NOT_not even stand to keep reading ! On the contrary , all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult , after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature , and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction . That is just one example ... the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - Hockney claiming \" this is too good to have been done without NOT_optics \" NOT_or \" NOT_this NOT_was NOT_too NOT_difficult NOT_to NOT_have NOT_been NOT_done NOT_without NOT_optics \" - and I found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_disciplined NOT_enough NOT_in NOT_his NOT_own NOT_art , NOT_if NOT_that NOT_is NOT_indeed NOT_what NOT_he NOT_thinks . And , modern artists must remember this : nowadays , the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing NOT_like NOT_the NOT_education NOT_or NOT_practice NOT_time NOT_had NOT_by NOT_the NOT_old NOT_artists , NOT_for NOT_many NOT_reasons . Superior art education is very hard to find , and there are many distractions in the modern world ( TV , computers , having to hold a ' day job ' , lack of patrons , etc . ) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not NOT_live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did . Therefore , most will never attain the skill of the old masters . But that is certainly no NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_assume NOT_that NOT_the NOT_old NOT_masters NOT_could NOT_not NOT_have NOT_done NOT_what NOT_they NOT_did NOT_without NOT_the NOT_help NOT_of NOT_technology!Some NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_examples NOT_used as ' evidence ' refer to ' odd ' proportion , perspective , etc . in otherwise masterful work . I am surprised that this author ( and those readers who are artists ) apparently does not NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_throughout NOT_history , NOT_great NOT_artists NOT_did NOT_NOT NOT_necessarily NOT_strive NOT_for NOT_EXACT NOT_realism - even nowadays , photorealism is not NOT_necessarily NOT_considered NOT_great NOT_art NOT_by NOT_many NOT_artists , NOT_because NOT_after NOT_all NOT_we NOT_are NOT_ARTISTS NOT_not NOT_cameras ! NOT_The NOT_point NOT_of NOT_realist NOT_art NOT_is NOT_to NOT_ACCENTUATE NOT_the NOT_reality , NOT_not NOT_to NOT_copy NOT_it ! NOT_Therefore , NOT_many NOT_inconsistencies NOT_in NOT_proportion , NOT_perspective , NOT_etc . evident in old masters ' work are not ' NOT_oddities ' NOT_or ' NOT_mistakes ' , but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition . All that being said , I think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist , since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without NOT_the NOT_help NOT_of ' NOT_trickery ' NOT_or NOT_technology NOT_of NOT_some NOT_sort . Instead , an art student should be encouraged to build skill , discipline , and self - reliance - because THAT is the true secret of the great masters", "5 Star Hotel . Not NOT_a NOT_chance . If the hotel claimed to be a 3 star hotel then I would be inclined to give it a rating of 4 or 5 trip advisor stars . However . the hotel claims to be 5 stars which it is not even close . so therefore deserves only two We arrived at 9 am and the staff was nice enough to allow us to check into our room several hours early . a nice suprise . The room is very small and uncomftorable . We had a beautiful view of an interior wall .   Five stars . Put some flowers out there or something - a horrific view .   Our two main complaints were 1 . the lack of facilities to relax after a long day . both in and outside of the room .   and 2 . the unbelievably stiff bed with starched paper for sheets . with a rip in the comforter which conveniently was the same comforter for three nights in a row .   A previous post mentioned sweets on the bed was a nice touch . do not NOT_get NOT_too NOT_excited - NOT_you NOT_get NOT_two NOT_jelly NOT_candies NOT_in NOT_a NOT_little NOT_cardboard NOT_box . The mini - bar prices are ludicrous . Eight euro . 10 USD . for a 12 ounce coke . Twelve euros . 15 USD . for mini cocktail bottles . We went to a local market and bought our own water and wine and saved an incredible amount The breakfast was average . Nice view . nice spread . but if you want a cup of coffee you can get up and get it yourself . The staff is not NOT_5 NOT_star NOT_standard . I was very frustrated with their lack of attention towards something as simple as coffee in your cup . And if you want cream in your coffee good luck Everyone raves about the hotel restaurant . We did not NOT_eat NOT_there . Take a look at the menu and you will understand . There is absolutely NO reason to eat there . We ate at a different restaurant every night and had an excellent meal . value . and experience at all . You can not NOT_convince NOT_me NOT_that NOT_the NOT_hotel NOT_restauant NOT_food NOT_merits NOT_a NOT_200 NOT_euro NOT_total NOT_price NOT_tag NOT_compared NOT_to NOT_the NOT_other NOT_places NOT_we NOT_ate NOT_at . Save your money and explore Rome by night . And definately do not NOT_listen NOT_to NOT_the NOT_doorman NOT_'s NOT_recommendation NOT_for NOT_a NOT_restaurant . He put us in a taxi and sent us to the most bland . boring restaurant down an alley . We ignored his advice and found Alfredos up the street and had a great experience . The doormen try most of the time . but are often two busy to spin the door for the ladies . They were shocked to hear that we wanted directions to walk to the colliseum . I asked directions and they told me it could not NOT_be NOT_done . What do you mean it ca not NOT_be NOT_done . We enjoy walking . and actually seeing the cities we visit . They insisted we take a taxi . Eventually he pointed us in the right direction which was a 35 minute walk - a nice 35 minute walk All in all we had a nice trip in Rome . However . ALL of our memories our from the city . not NOT_the NOT_hotel . The Hotel Splendid Royal is not NOT_a NOT_5 NOT_star NOT_hotel . You can find the real 5 stars up the hill and to the right .", "Not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_money NOT_you NOT_pay . I booked this hotel based on the number of rave reviews . but our experience at the hotel was quite disappointing . First of all . we were given a ridiculously small room . room 826 .   It was so small . we could not NOT_get NOT_around NOT_the NOT_bed . We had a lot of luggage and could not NOT_find NOT_a NOT_spot NOT_big NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_unpack NOT_in NOT_the NOT_room . so we had to unpack in the bathroom since it had more space than the bedroom did . The closet was tiny too . definitely not NOT_big NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_2 NOT_people . Our room was lavishly decorated . but all those draperies had so much dust in them . it was hard to breathe . The worst part about this room was a terrible . rock hard bed . I could hardly NOT_sleep NOT_on NOT_it and was waking up any time I had to turn . Also . when we checked in . our A C was not NOT_working NOT_properly . We brought this up with the front desk and they never got back to us whether it had been fixed or not . In the bathroom . our showerhead was leaking and the siding on the bathroom walls was coming off . Also . there was no NOT_regular NOT_electrical NOT_outlet NOT_except NOT_the NOT_one NOT_for NOT_the NOT_shaver NOT_I NOT_agree NOT_with NOT_many NOT_previous NOT_reviewers NOT_that NOT_the NOT_front NOT_desk NOT_personnel NOT_are NOT_aloof and not NOT_helpful NOT_at NOT_all . We had quite a disappointing experience with them In addition . when I asked about an ironing board and an iron . I was sent down to the basement where they set up an ironing board for me . I had to iron a 4-day supply of clothes all at once since I did not NOT_want NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_trip NOT_to NOT_that NOT_smelly NOT_dungeon - NOT_like NOT_basement NOT_again . I would not NOT_mind NOT_such NOT_set - NOT_up NOT_if NOT_I NOT_paid . 200 a night . but for the price we paid . around . 370 .   I expect a service that can iron for me . Although the area the hotel is located in is nice and quiet . I felt like we missed on a lot of experiences because it was too far away from restaurants and nightlife . An average cab ride cost us 10 Euros because drivers charged 5 Euros just to come and pick us up at the hotel . The restaurants around that residential area were not NOT_that NOT_great NOT_Overall . I felt it was such a poor value for the money we paid . I would not NOT_recommend NOT_staying NOT_at NOT_this NOT_mismanaged and run - down hotel as there are much better options in more convenient locations in Rome .", "Seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p. m. at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater # 3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) . [ theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture ] There are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons . They provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation . Watching \" flubber \" really clinched this idea for me , because it 's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy . It proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story . The film wastes no NOT_time NOT_in NOT_establishing NOT_its NOT_lighthearted , NOT_cartoony NOT_atmosphere . We meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist . Within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is . Phillip 's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer 's disease - is n't NOT_this NOT_rather NOT_lowbrow NOT_comedy ? NOT_He NOT_starts NOT_teaching NOT_chemistry NOT_after NOT_walking NOT_in NOT_on NOT_a NOT_nude NOT_figure NOT_drawing NOT_class ( NOT_an NOT_inappropriate NOT_joke NOT_for NOT_a NOT_kids ' NOT_movie NOT_if NOT_i NOT_ever NOT_saw NOT_one ) . We learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he 's forgotten . Sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she 'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) . But even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it 's no NOT_surprise NOT_the NOT_major NOT_conflicts NOT_here NOT_are NOT_related . Christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not NOT_only NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_steal NOT_phillip NOT_'s NOT_ideas , but his woman too . What 's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him ! Wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day . One of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film . The flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter . It 's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny . Unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing . Flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object . Most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip 's absent - mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along . But it 's clear how weak this premise is from the get - go and the film just gets worse . All the jokes involve people getting hit by fast - moving , flubber - powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that do n't NOT_fly NOT_well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air . It 's all presented with complete logic , and no NOT_one NOT_believes NOT_flubber NOT_exists even when they see it with their own eyes . During the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , \" i think they might be cheating , \" to which the referee replies , \" there 's no NOT_rules NOT_about NOT_jumping NOT_too NOT_high . \" \" predictable \" does n't NOT_begin NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_the NOT_motions NOT_the NOT_film NOT_goes NOT_through , NOT_especially NOT_after NOT_the NOT_halfway NOT_point . And it 's not NOT_how NOT_terribly NOT_contrived NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_is , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_the NOT_way NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_broken NOT_down NOT_scene - NOT_by - NOT_scene , NOT_with NOT_absolutely NOT_no NOT_transition . Not NOT_only NOT_that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears . I 'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it 's almost forgivable when you realize they 're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing . It 's safe to say everything that could be bad about \" flubber \" is . The only original element the film has is the world 's first romance between a machine and a human . But this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you wo n't .", "I wanted to like this book ...   I enjoyed the first two in the series .   But this one left me a bit dry ...   Babylon Rising : The Europa Conspiracy by Tim Lahaye and Bob Phillips . This continues the story of Michael Murphy , a college professor teaching biblical archaeology .   He is now heading off to Iraq to follow a tip on the location of \" The Handwriting on the Wall \" from the days of Daniel .   He 's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area , and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life .   Talon and the mysterious Seven are trying to eliminate him , and there are a few attempts on his life .   Mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on New York designed to throw America into an economic and national panic , as well as to prompt the UN to move their headquarters to the ancient city of Babylon .   Murphy , for someone who 's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean , finds himself in the middle of all this ... As I said , I really wanted to like this book .   The Murphy character is likeable , and I enjoyed the action .   But the plotline was spotty and over the top .   Murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him ( highly unlikely ) .   Everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time ( over the top ) .   The story attempted to be both a Christian End Times novel and a terrorist suspense novel , and they did n't NOT_do NOT_either NOT_one NOT_especially NOT_well .   Murphy 's growing infatuation with Isis was rather repetitive with the \" she 's so beautiful \" and \" could she be interested in me \" interludes .   And finally , none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_plotlines NOT_wrapped NOT_up .   You got to the end and thought \" so ? \"   Fine if you 're ready to read the next installment , but not NOT_good NOT_if NOT_you NOT_started NOT_here NOT_or NOT_you NOT_have NOT_to NOT_wait NOT_some NOT_months NOT_for NOT_the NOT_next NOT_one ... Part of me wants to be nice , give the book the benefit of the doubt , and rate it a \" 3 \" .   But the authors are better than this , and I 've come to expect more from someone who 's been doing this for a long time ...   If you 're committed to the series , you 'll want / have / need to read it , but just do n't NOT_come NOT_in NOT_with NOT_your NOT_expectations NOT_very NOT_high ..", "Conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children 's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty - five or thirty years after the item was made . That 's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re - visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives . Check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you 'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks . There 's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen . Boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work - a - day world for a long time . They 'd like to re - capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore .

The british television series began in 1961 . Super secret agent john steed ( then - patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then - diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for .

Steed ( now - ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now - uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england 's weather . That 's about as much of a plot as we have . There 's some footage about a lot of other things that either do n't NOT_make NOT_sense NOT_or NOT_make even less sense . We get betrayal for some unknown reason . Evil clones appear and vanish and have no NOT_connection NOT_to NOT_the NOT_film . Remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no NOT_good NOT_reason . There 's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no NOT_idea why anyone 's in it . The spy agency is run by a man called \" mother \" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named \" father \" who is blind ... at Least in some scenes . There 's probably a reason for all of this , but we 'll never know it . Macnee makes an appearance of sorts . He is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing . A group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel - colored teddy bear outfits . At first it 's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy . The movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner . It feels like major portions of the film are missing . The storyline jumps rather than flows . Reportedly the film was re - cut several times . This is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing . There 's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher . Other than that , the effects are second - rate . The weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes . Thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it does n't NOT_work . She looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there 's no NOT_spark . Fiennes fares even less well . Macnee 's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor . Fiennes ' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown - up clothes who has never been out of his home town .

The action scenes are difficult to follow . Director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of \" diabolique \" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it should n't NOT_be . Things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering . The primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads . Witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination . Admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there 's no NOT_chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever . One of emma peel 's first lines of dialog is \" rules are made to be broken . \" It does n't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_better . Advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone . The release date was changed several times . Connery refuses to promote the film . There was no NOT_screening NOT_for NOT_critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers .

Despite advertising itself as having disabled facilities . the two lifts at the hotel were so small that neither could accommodate a guest in a wheelchair . This made access impossible to any area other than the reception . Fortunately . in our case . my wife still has a limited mobility and we were able to collapse our wheelchair and access a lift . but being forced to stand in such cramped confinement caused pain and inconvenience each time .

Our room was shabby and the floor was dirty . The view was of an alley wall a couple of metres away . The bathroom was satisfactory except that the door was broken and hung dangerously . The wardrobe doors were also broken and this made access difficult . There would have been insufficient room generally for anyone permanently confined to a wheelchair . The hotel was very conveniently positioned for access to the leaning tower site which was impressive and must be the main . if not NOT_the NOT_only NOT_reason . for anyone wanting to visit this city . There was paint peeling off the facia of the hotel which . in fairness . complemented many of the other buildings in Pisa which were similarly neglected and shabby . In our opinion . the four star status awarded to this hotel is inappropriate as the standards fall far short of other four star hotels that we have experienced .

Both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not NOT_only NOT_the NOT_look NOT_of NOT_their NOT_graphic NOT_counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty - headed character motivations . In panel - sized morsels , implausible plots and \" rambo \" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it 's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures . Spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without NOT_irony NOT_by NOT_sheen ) , NOT_then NOT_set NOT_on NOT_fire and left for dead . Though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here 's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan 's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) . He is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon . But when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he ca n't NOT_be NOT_the NOT_evil NOT_superdemon NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_expected NOT_to NOT_be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death . Typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects - laden ninety minute rock video . While the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn 's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold . But the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they do n't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_single NOT_scene NOT_together NOT_before NOT_simmons ' NOT_death ! ) , NOT_conflict ( NOT_who NOT_will NOT_triumph NOT_is NOT_not NOT_anybody NOT_'s NOT_guess ) , and believability ( not NOT_that NOT_i NOT_expected NOT_it ) .

While last year 's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power . Spawn is an in - your - face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they have n't NOT_the NOT_faintest NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_movie .", "\" you ca n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_of NOT_this . It 's all mine ! \" --- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested . An evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him . For kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered . When something goes wrong and one of the presence 's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped . They enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether - realm . Her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed . The king 's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice . During the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled . Abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love . In this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm . After each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn 's . Because of the screw - up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself . As alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered . If there 's one thing i ca n't NOT_stand NOT_when NOT_i NOT_see NOT_a NOT_film , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_when NOT_the NOT_film NOT_is NOT_pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty . Films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list . This film is essentially an 80 minute stalk - and - slash film ( following the dante 's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot .

Compelling , but ultimately not . The opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images . The credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information does n't NOT_pop NOT_up NOT_until NOT_near NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sequence . When the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv . At least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett . At the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without NOT_the NOT_heavy NOT_breathing ) . For some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance . One over - alled cretin handles the presence 's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there 's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier - wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog - half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds . Why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of \" rednecks \" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ? And how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? I can barely NOT_get NOT_more NOT_than NOT_two NOT_together NOT_all NOT_at NOT_once NOT_at NOT_any NOT_given NOT_moment . The most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging / salting sequence . The character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . A priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . He picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no NOT_interest NOT_whatsoever . When she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . The presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . When it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . The box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . Contains nudity and graphic violence \" . While both is certainly true , there does n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_much NOT_of NOT_either NOT_in NOT_any NOT_large NOT_amounts . Besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi - graphic self - surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . As for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . Ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b - movie . com . It has been presented in in full - frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8 mm ) is pretty decent . Besides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b - movie . com ) , a making - of video is also available called on thin ice . I have n't NOT_had NOT_the NOT_opportunity NOT_to NOT_see NOT_the NOT_documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set .", "Bobby Bare is a great singer , one of the most underrated country singers ever .

And when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to \" exploit \" her by having her wear a bikini , the audience bursts into laughter . Exploit mariah carey , who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ? Come on !

Talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept , and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline , there 's an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view . Perhaps one of the reasons ms . carey suffered her highly - publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker . On the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" glitter \" is a pathetic 1 . Right now , it 's tops on my list of the worst of 2001 .", "When walt disney pictures announced a live - action feature based on the ' 60s cartoon series of \" mr . magoo , \" special interests groups representing the vision - impaired let out a cry of dismay . Mr. Magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . In fact , they were wrong . Mr. Magoo is not NOT_just NOT_an NOT_insult NOT_to NOT_the NOT_blind and near - blind , it 's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . It 's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . Look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you 'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . Magoo . The best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . The worst , mr . Magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . The first problem with mr . Magoo is the script . Despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . Magoo is comically barren . From beginning to end , there 's not NOT_a NOT_laugh NOT_to NOT_be NOT_found . Every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . You 'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that 's not NOT_the NOT_case . I 've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . Then there 's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing NOT_like NOT_the NOT_animated NOT_character ( NOT_memorably NOT_voiced NOT_by NOT_jim NOT_backus ) . In the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . Lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . Magoo . Even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we 're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but \" top form \" is not NOT_a NOT_phrase NOT_i NOT_would NOT_use NOT_to NOT_describe NOT_his NOT_performance NOT_here . This is strictly a take - the - money - and- run operation . The story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . The cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . The bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts - type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . Matt keeslar portrays one of magoo 's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . The bumbling man 's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . Most of mr . Magoo 's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . The cartoon violence level in this film does n't NOT_approach NOT_that NOT_of NOT_home NOT_alone NOT_3 NOT_or NOT_flubber , but it 's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . There 's a non - violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean 's recent , similar misadventure , it does n't NOT_hold NOT_up NOT_well . Then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo 's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . I 'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . Tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . His chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . Like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . It is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . Magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . The screening i attended was wall - to - wall kids , and , for the most part , they did n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_enjoying NOT_themselves . When the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . Her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . Mr. Magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .", "Disappointing .

Despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . The problem is , of course , that there are n't NOT_many NOT_good NOT_roles NOT_available NOT_for NOT_black NOT_women . Take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve 's bayou , and all that 's left is a chance to be someone 's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . As a result , for pinkett smith 's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . Actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v. s. Mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . The film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on - screen relationship between pinkett smith 's woo and tommy davidson 's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two are n't NOT_forced NOT_to NOT_play NOT_it NOT_dumb NOT_for NOT_the NOT_sake NOT_of NOT_an NOT_endless NOT_barrage NOT_of NOT_cheap NOT_gags . Unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple - digit i. q. The situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit - coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . Woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . Her latest relationship , with a testosterone - overdosed drug - dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . Now , her transvestite / medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she 's about to meet mr . right , and that he 'll be a virgo . Later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . It 's not NOT_love NOT_at NOT_first NOT_sight , NOT_however . Things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . In the one - hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it 's only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . As in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . The question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? In a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_familiar NOT_it NOT_is . In woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . For those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there 's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . Sadly , that 's one of the film 's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . Despite exuding charm from every pore , there 's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c. johnson 's script . Since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops .", "not NOT_that NOT_great .   we stayed there 3 nights . the room is small but ok . the front desk personnel was typical Euro .

This carl \" apollo creed \" weathers vehicle features the traditional cop vs. evil establishment crook , and relies on all the ' 80s trappings , from the token heroin addict who needs a fix to the shouting superior officer . Somewhere in between come the explosions and boobs , although there is a curious lack of exploding boobs . Weathers is action jackson , a detroit cop known for all sorts of crazy vigilante techniques . Speaking of one past criminal apprehension , jackson 's superior yells , \" you tore his arm off ! \" Jackson replies , \" he had a spare . \" Jackson has been busted down to a desk job because of past problems with auto manufacturer dellaplane ( craig t. nelson ) and now has to act as department liaison to a dinner honoring nelson .

It 's a testament to the ' 80s that sharon stone is killed off within the first 30 minutes but vanity survives the whole movie .

This female revenge fantasy , vivica a. fox plays shante smith , a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success : a mansion , a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky , hot - shot lawyer , morris chestnut . She 's at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl - friends ( mo'nique , wendy racquel robinson , tamala jones ) . \" when your man messes up , no NOT_matter NOT_how NOT_small NOT_it NOT_is , \" NOT_she NOT_smugly NOT_decrees , \" NOT_yuh NOT_gots NOT_to NOT_punish NOT_him . \" So when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival , gabrielle union , she devises her own version of \" the rules , \" a 10-day \" tough love \" emotionally punishing plan to get him back . Unfortunately , writer / director mark brown ( \" how to be a player \" ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill , self - congratulatory shante smith is a smirking , superficial , spiteful shrew who does n't NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_rational NOT_rules NOT_can NOT_not NOT_always NOT_be NOT_applied NOT_to NOT_love . Having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the \" day one , \" \" day two \" title - card device underscores the tedium . Comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut 's boisterous best - friend , and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who 's given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson . But the out - takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself . On the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" two can play that game \" is smarmy if slick 4 , filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements ( coca - cola , miller genuine draft ) but little else .

Jack is being blackmailed , and he asks harry to deliver the payoff . Instead of the blackmailers , harry finds a dying ex - cop ( m. Emmet walsh ) . As more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine 's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who 's willing to kill to keep that secret buried . Newman . sarandon . Hackman . With an a - list cast of oscar laureates like that , \" twilight \" would seem very promising . However , the script is tired and predictable . It would serve well as a tv - movie - of - the - week , possibly with some 1970 's detective hero reprising his role . The appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia . \" twilight \" wants very much to be a 1940 's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell . All of the standard tropes are here : a hard - boiled p. i. Among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation . The script offers little originality , and co - authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 . Elmer bernstein 's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note - for - note from a vintage noir . The lead actors try hard - none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_three NOT_has NOT_every NOT_made NOT_less NOT_than NOT_a NOT_full NOT_effort , even when burdened with a bad script . They try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters . Harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine . Jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry 's love for catherine . Catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully - maintained veneer . \" twilight \" wants to be character - driven like \" nobody 's fool \" ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with . \" twilight \" also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry 's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine 's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry 's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .", "Here 's my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album : If a song is remixed , then that remix should be better than the original song .

These \" remixes \" do n't NOT_make NOT_the NOT_originals NOT_better , NOT_they NOT_actually NOT_make NOT_them NOT_worse . The beats sound like throw away beats from an old JT Tha Bigga Figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered / changed so that they sound updated ( removing Snoop from \" 2 of Amerikka 's Most ... \" and distorting Pac 's vocals when he says his name is just terrible ) , but these changes are only for the worst . In short , all aspects of this album are sorry . The guests are wack and the beats are generic , hollow , \" clubby \" beats . Remember y' all , when these albums were dropped back in ' 96 the beats had more meat to them . There is one decent track though . \" Life Goes On \" gets a different look and I 'm not NOT_so NOT_sure NOT_that NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_all NOT_that NOT_bad . I find it tolerable , but I could see why why someone would n't NOT_like NOT_it . But this is coming from someone that was n't NOT_all NOT_that NOT_crazy NOT_about NOT_the NOT_original NOT_because NOT_I NOT_was NOT_n't NOT_feeling NOT_the NOT_beat . If you enjoyed the original , then stick with that . Also , I like that the original version of \" Hit ' Em Up \" was used here . In this version , ' Pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with ( thus proving that he was n't NOT_anti - NOT_east NOT_coast , NOT_just NOT_anti - NOT_Bad NOT_Boy).Whoever NOT_gave NOT_the NOT_green NOT_light NOT_to NOT_have NOT_this NOT_released NOT_should NOT_be NOT_fired .

There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail , for one . But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro , which is about as clique as you can get . That said , art is subjective , and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews . But I find most of it unlistenable . I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating ; this is definitely not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_them", "\" there will be another , \" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ?

The idea of spinning artist james o'barr 's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world . Given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions . Of course , it does n't . Stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee 's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death . I remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality . In flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real - time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind . It 's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist 's delight -- but it 's also horrifying and fascinating . City of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully . There 's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word - of - mouth will likely ensure that it wo n't NOT_be NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_success . In fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings . ( i 've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . ) So much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup . This time , ashe ( french - accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead . Perez might have some screen presence if he 's given something to do with himself , but here he 's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face . At first , he 's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave . He 's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film . Kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank . Tattooed with angels ' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no NOT_purpose , NOT_not even as seductress . The gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve . Iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film . Like all good things here , he 's dispatched too soon and without NOT_much NOT_imagination . In the meantime , we 're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah 's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they were n't NOT_distinctly NOT_secondhand . Even the soundtrack is tired . More than anything i 've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it 's a movie with a lousy script but a great look . Critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work is n't NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_per NOT_se . He 's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery . His major stylistic failing is that he ca n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_direct NOT_an NOT_action NOT_scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie . But as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that was n't , NOT_the NOT_performers NOT_who NOT_could NOT_n't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved . Who bought david s. goyer 's anemic script , anyway ? The producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .", "I remember really liking this album when it was first released , even though I could tell it was not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_same NOT_league as The Real Thing or Angel Dust . Listening to the album now , I realise it is by far the worst FNM album since Mike Patton joined . The whole album feels very rushed , it has a sparse , raw sound , very different to Angel Dust 's polish . The music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like B - sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums . It was a shame to see guitarist Jim Martin depart . He had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of FNM 's style and make up . However , being replaced ( for a short time anyway ) by Trey Spruance is no NOT_bad NOT_thing - NOT_anyone NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_his NOT_work NOT_with NOT_Mr NOT_Bungle NOT_will NOT_know NOT_he NOT_is NOT_a NOT_genius NOT_with NOT_a NOT_guitar and his work here on King For A Day is excellent , it 's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired . How ironic then that on such a disappointing album , FNM produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius , full of the care and effort , rhythm and melodiousness FNM were famous for . Beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum , it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is FNM as you 'd expect them . Another track that deserves special mention is Cuckoo or Caca , a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals . It 's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness FNM once held in abundance . It 's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness ( Caralho Voador , Take This Bottle , The Last To Know ) and 2nd rate metal ( Ugly In The Morning , What A day , Get Out ) . Star A.D. could have been vintage FNM but in the end falls flat , Evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like Ricochet , The Gentle Art Of Making enemies and Digging The Grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing . However , the album does end on another note of vintage FNM - Just A Man is funny and catchy with Patton having fun doing his Tom Jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not NOT_wanting NOT_it NOT_to NOT_end . Patton 's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you ca n't NOT_help but feel he was a little bored here - I think his heart always really lay with the far superior Mr Bungle , where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material . I suppose it 's not NOT_surprising NOT_that NOT_King NOT_For NOT_A NOT_Day NOT_is NOT_a NOT_largely NOT_empty NOT_affair , NOT_the NOT_departure NOT_of NOT_Jim NOT_Martin and the diminished presence of Roddy Bottum at rehearsals meant that FNM 's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to . It 's really an album for Faith No NOT_More NOT_fans , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_certainly NOT_no NOT_classic NOT_despite NOT_some NOT_classic NOT_material and I feel it was the beginning of the end for FNM , they would improve with their next album , Album Of The Year - but only marginally .", "A sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom .

The film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who ca n't NOT_get NOT_by NOT_on NOT_looks NOT_alone NOT_in NOT_this NOT_transparently NOT_predictable NOT_story . Pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var 's \" all about my mother , \" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face . The best you can say about her , is that she 's not NOT_to NOT_blame NOT_for NOT_this NOT_picture NOT_being NOT_so NOT_off . This exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will . The story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents ' cook . To cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure . She is able to control it now as long as she does n't NOT_drive NOT_a NOT_car , NOT_ride NOT_elevators , NOT_follow NOT_in NOT_dancing , and is the woman on top when making love . In other words , she has to be in control of things . In her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him . They open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he 's a loafer . One night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco . We do n't NOT_see NOT_her NOT_in NOT_flight , NOT_so NOT_i NOT_ca NOT_n't NOT_tell NOT_how NOT_she NOT_handled NOT_her NOT_motion NOT_sickness NOT_problem -- NOT_unless NOT_she NOT_flew NOT_the NOT_plane . She visits her friend 's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross - dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene . To cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again . Her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show . You can really write the script from here on by yourself ... as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no NOT_chef NOT_to NOT_replace NOT_his NOT_wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good . So he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again . He brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window . He sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no NOT_longer NOT_charmed NOT_by NOT_him . When he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he 's hired as a regular on the show . The show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national . But they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he 's a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low - cut vanna white type of sexy dresses . Cliff , her would - be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big - shots , even though he loved everything she did . These tv scenes were not NOT_only NOT_bad NOT_stereotype NOT_scenes NOT_of NOT_tv NOT_honchos , NOT_they NOT_were NOT_revolting . It was an insult to one 's intelligence .

I just bought it , played it once , and will NEVER play it again", "\" the beach \" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder . Every forty minutes of this two - hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act . It starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment . But then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of \" blue lagoon \" . Forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of \" lord of the flies \" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs . By the time it 's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about . The main character of \" the beach \" is angst - ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) . He travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you 're looking for a good time . Richard 's voice - over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown . This seedy environment is just what richard is looking for . He checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) . He seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis . Though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen . Moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life . Captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey . They are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard 's . Once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard 's growing desire for francoise . This particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no NOT_question NOT_in NOT_my NOT_mind NOT_that NOT_francoise NOT_will NOT_wind NOT_up NOT_with NOT_richard . Etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand . It 's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view . And once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers . For example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards . And the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark . There are several ideas that are introduced in \" the beach \" and each one could merit its own feature - length film . There 's the man vs. nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia - gone - awry angle . But the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred . Dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through . Consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .", "I think Ms Hewitt misses the mark , yes for an actress turned singer she 's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not NOT_her NOT_talent as a singer ...

We have stayed in Pisa many times at the beginning of holidays in Tuscany . however on this occasion we decided to book My hotels galilei for ourselves as we were arriving late at night in Pisa and needed to travel early in the morning to Volterra . We also booked the same Hotel for a large number of our family and friends who would be arriving into Pisa a few nights later on their way to join us for our Wedding in Volterra . What a big mistake . . the hotel advertises that it has a shuttle bus which will collect guests from the airport . whioch is only a five minute drive from their hotel . What they do not NOT_tell NOT_you NOT_is NOT_that NOT_this NOT_shuttle NOT_stops NOT_very NOT_early NOT_in NOT_the NOT_evening . and that if you need transport you either have to have your own car or pay for a taxi which can be extremely difficult to access late at night . On the evening on which we oursleves were arriving we had our own transport . however we had booked this hotel for the large group partly on account of the fact that a shuttle bus would alleviate any transport difficulties for them . When I contacted the hotel prior to the group of our friends and families departing to organise the shuttle I was greeted coldly and told that the shuttle bus did not NOT_run NOT_after NOT_11 NOT_pm - NOT_the NOT_flight NOT_arrived NOT_at NOT_11 NOT_20pm . My friend who was also travelling in this group contacted this hotel and was told that the shuttle finished at 7p m. When I initially contacted the hotel twice by email to try to sort the situation out they did not NOT_respond and I had to phone them . Again a cold repsonse . When I explained that one of the reasons that I had booked their hotel for this group was because of their shuttle bus - there were a number of young children also travelling . and a shuttle waiting for them would mean that there would have been no NOT_delay NOT_transporting NOT_them NOT_quickly NOT_to NOT_the NOT_hotel and to their beds . . the hotel suggested that they could organise a shuttle at a cost of 60 - 80 euros . After much disgruntlement and several emails the Hotel agreed to arrange a free shuttle . however the group were brought in two separate runs and the driver was rude and ignorant to them . This was also reflected in how the group were greeted at the Reception desk .

A major fuss on the part of the receptionist ensued before the group were allocated rooms . however most were feeling uncomfortable and were looking forward to leaving the next day . They have all said that they would never either recommend nor stay in this hotel again On the evening that myself and my husband arrived a few days before the group we were greeted by two male receptionists who we can only guess had been made aware of the issue of the shuttle bus which I had made while in Ireland . and they sneered to each other when they took our passports and saw our names . We felt that th hotel staff dealt in a very unprofessional and disrespectful manner with us and with our friends and families a few days late . and we were very angry about this considering the amount of business we had given to them We would recommend that you stay either in another airport hotel or drive the few minutes further and stay in the centre of Pisa - maybe in the lovely Victoria Hotel - but if possible avoid this Hotel at all costs .", "\" The Island of Lost Maps \" is the story of a petty crook named Gilbert Bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the ' 90s .   Posing as a researcher , Bland would enter rare - book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single - edged razor .   Then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers .   Before being busted at the Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , he had stolen more than a half million dollars ' worth of maps . \"Island \" is the first book for author Miles Harvey .   In the book , he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book .   He is only partly successful .   I found the material on Bland 's crime fascinating .   However , Bland as a subject does not NOT_fill NOT_the NOT_entire NOT_350 NOT_pages NOT_because NOT_his NOT_life NOT_is NOT_dull .   Unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text .   I found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime .

Overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) . So when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it 's in trouble . Jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically \" uplifting \" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie does n't NOT_realize NOT_it . Williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii . One night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high - ranking german officer for his punishment . Jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast . The announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant \" heil hitler ! \" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob 's ghetto . Liberation ! he thinks . The next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along . Soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death . This is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate . The danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger . In a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home . Apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear . He and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning . The moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine . But jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false . Such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations are n't NOT_met , NOT_the NOT_results NOT_are NOT_far NOT_worse NOT_than NOT_if NOT_there NOT_was NOT_no NOT_hope . That 's the film 's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false .

Robin williams does n't NOT_inject NOT_the NOT_film NOT_with NOT_life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent . He is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless .

Jakob the liar will be compared with last year 's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a \" holocaust comedy \" . It 's not NOT_a NOT_comedy . It tries , sometimes , but it rarely works . Is it a melodrama ? A war movie ? A character study ? No , NOT_no , and no .

But wait . The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953 , the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell . Meanwhile , Burke , a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century . What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times . There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society . Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society . Kirk writes , \" What men really are seeking , or ought to seek , is not NOT_the NOT_right NOT_to NOT_govern NOT_themselves , but the right to be governed well \" but what he offers is a lack of true representation . The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth , intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender . Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as ` magnificent ' before quoting his racist vitriol ? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro - slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a ` defender of minorities ' and praises John Randolph for , among other things , opposing doctrines of racial equality . Kirk goes on about Calhoun 's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $ 1000 fine . He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery . For Calhoun states rights were nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_self NOT_serving NOT_attempt NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_slavery NOT_safe . Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern ` anti - slavery agitation ' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty , although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty . One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a ` strong protest against domination by class or region' . Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state . The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line . Quoting Samuel Coleridge , the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant ; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control . Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore , Russell Kirk urges that , \" state and church ought never to be separate entities , true religion is not NOT_merely NOT_an NOT_expression NOT_of NOT_national NOT_spirit ; NOT_it NOT_rises NOT_far NOT_superior NOT_to NOT_earthly NOT_law , NOT_being , NOT_indeed , NOT_the NOT_source NOT_of NOT_all NOT_law \" . Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction . I have to wonder if , like the modern Reconstructionist , Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers . He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice . The third thread would be Kirk 's anti - intellectual ( or perhaps pro - stupid ) stance . He refers to human reason as ` puny ' and ` impotent ' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition . ` Prejudice ' , he writes , ` is of ready application in the emergency ; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue , and does not NOT_leave NOT_the NOT_man NOT_hesitating NOT_in NOT_the NOT_moment NOT_of NOT_decision , NOT_skeptical , NOT_puzzled , and unresolved ' . Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain . Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority . In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident . Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete fa\u001aade . I found Russell Kirk 's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day .", "Very Disappointed .

Welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l. a. and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . Firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves 's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year 's crop of movies . As our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" We then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung - ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" Having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest .

Miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . In a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . As it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f. windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl 's face . Our show 's two heroes , the crew 's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second - in - command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . In a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . The manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . This mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life - or - death decision to make . The chopper with the fire - retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . Will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica 's two firefighting buddies ? She has only seconds to decide who will be saved .

Most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . He flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . Arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . Using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building 's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust .

The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody , psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain . For this release the band moves into more ' mainstream ' territory , eschewing album - wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach . Unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't NOT_work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned . If you 're new to the Bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums ( Crocodiles , Heaven Up Here , Porcupine and Ocean Rain ) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers", "Synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride .

Review : given the absurdism of its would - be plot , it 's unlikely that \" original sin \" could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking , regardless of writer , director or stars . This is , at its heart , b - movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions . That said , \" original sin \" could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it . Instead , cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production , and directs it as such . The result is a vapid , uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses , as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill . Consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly - lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show . Cristofer does n't even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless . At least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but are n't NOT_being NOT_given NOT_the NOT_chance . The same can not NOT_be NOT_said NOT_of NOT_jane , NOT_whose NOT_billy NOT_is NOT_nebbish and transparent .

The characters act , react , and interact at half - speed , making for one * excruciatingly * long sit .

Critique : an artsy - fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , does n't NOT_really NOT_come NOT_together as a whole , with over - the - top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through .

I guess that i was expecting the former going in . The film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant . But it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience . Chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on - screen ) . Well , i personally do n't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_those NOT_films , and did n't NOT_really NOT_get NOT_into NOT_the NOT_whole \" NOT_show \" NOT_atmosphere NOT_of NOT_this NOT_movie NOT_either . I guess i might 've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just did n't NOT_care NOT_enough NOT_about NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_to NOT_delve NOT_into NOT_the \" NOT_so NOT_the NOT_butterfly NOT_represents NOT_his NOT_freedom ? \" NOT_Side NOT_of NOT_things . All i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and did n't NOT_make NOT_me NOT_feel NOT_any NOT_more NOT_fulfilled . What was hedwig 's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ? What happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ? ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? ) What ever happened to the lawsuit ? And more ... All of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat . If the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his / her sexuality , then that 's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well . I did n't NOT_get NOT_it . The film 's humor also did n't NOT_tickle NOT_my NOT_funny NOT_bone NOT_either . Then again , i 've seen many a film in these art - house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen . Some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added \" atmosphere \" of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience . But being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i did n't NOT_leave NOT_the NOT_theater NOT_very NOT_satisfied . I came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers . I will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam - rock scene . Note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single \" mainstream \" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself . But having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the \" official \" critics , while i , a regular \" joblo \" in the audience , just would n't NOT_get NOT_what NOT_all NOT_the NOT_fuss NOT_was NOT_about . This movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews . Where 's joblo coming from ? Moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love 's labour 's lost ( 8/10 )", "Would not NOT_stay NOT_here NOT_again .

Why work in a hotel if you so obviously do not NOT_like NOT_dealing NOT_with NOT_people .   Also . prior to arriving I emailed someone at the hotel to have a taxi waiting for us at the airport . He charged us 70 euros to drive us to the hotel . On our last day we decided to take a taxi from the local taxi stand just up the road . as we found 70 euros to be a bit much .   That taxi driver charged us 30 euros . We were completely ripped off the first time . This is such an insult as the hotel booked that taxi for us . Finally . the walls at Hotel Fiume are paper thin .

The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic .   If you want romance , skip this .   It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up", "14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . In 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross - country journey with the destination of wally world , a world - renowned theme park in california . We laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . Two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . Now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . They 've been cremated . Vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill - fated father of two . The premise is basically the same . Clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . His wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . Of course a \" vacation \" movie would n't NOT_be NOT_complete NOT_without NOT_good NOT_ole NOT_eddie ( NOT_reprised NOT_by NOT_randy NOT_quaid ) , NOT_the NOT_misfit NOT_cousin , NOT_showing NOT_up NOT_at NOT_all NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_times . There is n't NOT_too NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_plot NOT_here NOT_when NOT_it NOT_comes NOT_right NOT_down NOT_to NOT_it . It 's really just a skit movie . There are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not NOT_a NOT_real NOT_term as far as i know . The first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . The second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . Vegas vacation comes off like the first . A good example of the latter would be last year 's black sheep . The problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it does n't NOT_really NOT_fit NOT_into NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_mold . In these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i. e. Have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . Such is the case with this movie 's mini - plots . Clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold 's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake i d and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer . The simple fact is : this movie is n't NOT_funny . At first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . Chase plays clark griswold really well . He made the character and he is the character . D'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie does n't NOT_show NOT_any NOT_signs NOT_of NOT_redemption . As for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . The \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing NOT_to NOT_them . They 're so generic , you 'll expect the credits to read \" girl # 1 as audrey griswold \" . Vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . Yes , it 's true that vegas vacation is n't even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . First off , why did they leave off the national lampoon 's heading on the title ? I could n't NOT_find NOT_any NOT_reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon did n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_be NOT_associated NOT_with NOT_such NOT_a NOT_lame NOT_film . That 's saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they 'd be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they did n't . There is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . The first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 's including mr . Mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller 's day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . Wowzers ! What a r ? sum ? ! Looking at the names , you 'd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980 's . Well that 's not NOT_all . This guy also brought us 90 's hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . Vegas vacation , however , did n't NOT_have NOT_john NOT_hughes NOT_behind NOT_it , and the loss is very obvious . This time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made - for - tv movies . Vegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made - for - tv sequel . If this sounds like a wild idea , it 's not . Revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . Vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a. m. Sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it 's quite out of place . Stephen kessler 's jejune direction does n't NOT_help NOT_things NOT_either . He only makes the film even more tv - movie - ish . Each consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . We started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co - writing ghostbusters . Not NOT_too NOT_bad . Then we had national lampoon 's european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who 's talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . Lastly we had national lampoon 's christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s. chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . Kessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . Granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . If you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still is n't NOT_anything NOT_here NOT_worth NOT_seeing . If you loved them , do n't NOT_ruin NOT_your NOT_good NOT_impressions NOT_of NOT_the NOT_series NOT_by NOT_indulging NOT_in NOT_this NOT_tragic NOT_example NOT_of NOT_cinema NOT_ala NOT_carte . If you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?", "As a hot - shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients . He is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness 's testimony . And , on top of that , he 's a damn good trial lawyer . In the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it does n't NOT_hamper NOT_lomax NOT_'s NOT_desire NOT_to NOT_creatively NOT_squeeze NOT_his NOT_client NOT_through NOT_the NOT_doors NOT_of NOT_reasonable NOT_doubt , NOT_thereby NOT_getting NOT_an NOT_acquittal . His unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) . He is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full - time position as head of their newly - created criminal law division . Lomax is soon given the case of his life . He must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide . The draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell . He works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) . But what starts off as a promising john grisham - like story about conscience - stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story . It begins like a typical parable where a small - town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed . But milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm . Quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago . Freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton 's horrifying intent is finally revealed . The movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts . The first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big - city trial lawyer . The second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax . Unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere . Granted , the film is very handsome - looking . You 'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino . You 'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties . You 'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away . This was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub - plot . As with all thing 's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst . In the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background . His path from self - vanity to self - consciousness is never fully explored . His actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not NOT_fully NOT_known . Pacino 's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie . There is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited . The focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap . This movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time . However , while the devil 's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all .", "I did not NOT_enjoy NOT_this NOT_book NOT_at NOT_all NOT_because NOT_it NOT_was NOT_writen NOT_in NOT_a NOT_very NOT_distracting NOT_fashion .

He excels in double roles ( as in ' carry on- do n't NOT_lose NOT_your NOT_head ' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious . Barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques ' small but effective role as the rector 's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection . Jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on - screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part . Peter butterworth is not NOT_allowed NOT_to NOT_shine NOT_in NOT_his NOT_boring NOT_performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw 's character appears only briefly in the film . The only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the ' birds of paradise ' and sporting a fake french accent . When her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit ! A carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie .

But , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber . It 's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything . The whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful . This is not NOT_absent NOT_minded NOT_this NOT_is NOT_almost NOT_mindless and he is a professor . Well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded . Along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber . Thankfully or there would be no NOT_movie NOT_or NOT_any NOT_amusement NOT_for NOT_the NOT_audience . The flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own . This is there strictly for the kids . The properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs . Although amusing this is not NOT_original NOT_what NOT_so NOT_ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone . The poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible . Admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not NOT_compare NOT_very NOT_well NOT_to NOT_the NOT_original ( NOT_the NOT_absent NOT_minded NOT_professor ) . The whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable . The basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ? This just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance . As for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie . Giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it 's best forgotten , and prof . brainard 's flying robot weebo . Giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it was n't NOT_for NOT_scenes NOT_of NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_where NOT_you NOT_have NOT_the NOT_flubber NOT_dancing NOT_around NOT_on NOT_tables and books for no NOT_real NOT_reason NOT_other NOT_than NOT_to NOT_put NOT_in NOT_a NOT_bit NOT_of NOT_music and extend the length of the movie . The life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it was n't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good . Now , weebo is a totally different story . It 's a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too . This is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie . Yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters . The film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all . The acting by robin williams ( prof . Brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced . Most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not NOT_quite NOT_yet NOT_reached NOT_the NOT_age NOT_to NOT_12 . People when stood up at the altar , do n't NOT_usually NOT_give NOT_third NOT_chances . Or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards , but what can be expected this is a children 's movie . Flubber , as a movie does little original and is nothing NOT_special NOT_in NOT_any NOT_respect . With the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great . It does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end , but it does not NOT_wash NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_original .

Should we return to Rome . we will never return to this hotel .", "Back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films . He could n't , NOT_of NOT_course , NOT_top NOT_the NOT_success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados . That quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b - movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , NOT_unwatchable NOT_genre NOT_products . The hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck 's brother aaron , is one of the last among them . Chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which should n't NOT_surprise NOT_anyone , NOT_considering NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_the NOT_partner NOT_is NOT_being NOT_played NOT_by NOT_michael NOT_parks , NOT_specialised NOT_for NOT_roles NOT_of NOT_usually NOT_very NOT_mean NOT_characters ) . Surviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent . He infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians . Since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not NOT_in NOT_this NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_movie , NOT_the NOT_biggest NOT_attraction NOT_of NOT_this NOT_film NOT_should NOT_have NOT_been NOT_action . Well , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not NOT_at NOT_all NOT_exciting . It is nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_monotonous NOT_series NOT_of NOT_scenes NOT_that NOT_contains NOT_violence NOT_too NOT_brutal even for this type of films . We know very little about norris ' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension . In the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade . During the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris . That caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation . The photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without NOT_any NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_justify NOT_the NOT_hour and half spent in watching it .", "Zoolook~ Jean - Michel Jarre is a case where the artist is way to avant - garde for his own best . After having made amazing albums such as Oxygene , Equinox and Magnetic Fields he unfortunately creates this mess of an album . I find it a bit too much like modern art , i.e. , confusing , confounding and impossible to grasp . It also seems like Jarre was a bit over confident when he recorded this album . He had recorded some of the best synth albums of all time and decided to create a total arts album and it just does not NOT_work . This is an album that should have stayed unrealesed since it is just to avant - garde and sounds more like an experimental sound session rather then as a well produced album . Very disapointing indeed !", "OK , I know I 'm going to get hammered for this ; once again , there goes my reviewer rating . But I just HAVE to be honest : this is a terrible story . OK , being that it 's Shakespeare , it 's prettily told , but it 's still a HORRIBLE story , and I ca n't NOT_imagine why otherwise sensible people like it . Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue - in - cheek ( it IS a comedy , after all ) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without NOT_any NOT_concern NOT_for NOT_whether NOT_they NOT_want NOT_it NOT_or NOT_not ; NOT_that NOT_would NOT_almost NOT_make NOT_it NOT_tolerable , NOT_if NOT_I NOT_could NOT_believe NOT_it . But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy , we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a \" happy \" one , and the situation at the end is far from pleasant . Or perhaps people believe ( I 've heard this claimed in all seriousness ) that Kate has actually \" triumphed \" at the end , having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly . Even if this were true , I 'd hardly NOT_consider NOT_it NOT_a \" NOT_happy \" NOT_anding , and personally , I see little evidence of it . No , NOT_what NOT_we NOT_actually NOT_have NOT_here NOT_is NOT_a NOT_story NOT_of NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_woman ( NOT_some NOT_people NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_like NOT_it NOT_simply NOT_because NOT_there NOT_IS NOT_a NOT_strong NOT_woman NOT_to NOT_be NOT_found NOT_in NOT_it ) NOT_being NOT_married NOT_against NOT_her NOT_will NOT_to NOT_a NOT_scheming NOT_golddigger NOT_who \" NOT_Tames \" NOT_her NOT_by NOT_blatent NOT_if NOT_indirect NOT_spousal NOT_abuse ( NOT_he NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_beat NOT_her , NOT_simply NOT_starves NOT_her and sleep - deprives her , as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants , up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives . Her spirit may or may not NOT_be NOT_broken , NOT_depending NOT_on NOT_how NOT_the NOT_part NOT_is NOT_played , but the fact remains that she 's forced to BEHAVE as if it is , and that 's not NOT_a NOT_message NOT_that NOT_should NOT_be NOT_bruited NOT_about NOT_in NOT_a \" NOT_comedy \" .

I have nothing NOT_against NOT_the NOT_mtv NOT_approach NOT_to NOT_filmmaking -- NOT_used NOT_properly NOT_it NOT_can NOT_save NOT_a NOT_movie ( NOT_see NOT_stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise . There are certain genres that just do n't NOT_go NOT_together . The film opens with a sequence that i still do n't NOT_understand . It involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten . In any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy - go - lucky brits with no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_make NOT_a NOT_living . They make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america . Their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier . His decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name \" gentleman highwaymen . \" Lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career . He demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals . Meanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who does n't NOT_want NOT_his NOT_plans NOT_to NOT_be NOT_foiled NOT_by NOT_his NOT_partner NOT_'s NOT_mindless NOT_romantic NOT_travails . Director jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father 's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none NOT_of NOT_his NOT_skill NOT_in NOT_actually NOT_moving NOT_the NOT_camera . Most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it 's impossible to comprehend what 's going on . The camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity . Instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention - deficit - disorder edits . He barely NOT_ever NOT_holds NOT_a NOT_shot NOT_for NOT_more NOT_than NOT_ten NOT_seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut . The weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- NOT_no -- NOT_conversations NOT_lasting NOT_over , NOT_say , NOT_20 NOT_seconds ) NOT_undermines NOT_character NOT_definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters . The love affair between macleane and rebecca is no NOT_different , NOT_emotionless and unrealistic . When the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no NOT_reason NOT_for NOT_us NOT_to NOT_believe NOT_it NOT_would NOT_be NOT_worth NOT_it NOT_for NOT_him NOT_to NOT_abandon NOT_his NOT_goal ; NOT_he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film . Plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no NOT_hope NOT_of NOT_succeeding NOT_on NOT_any NOT_level .

NONE here .   The hotel itself is quite decent . small but clean rooms and a bright reception area . However . the staff are just awful . A miscommunication led to the reservation for the wrong dates . even though they had all of my flight info . and boy were they ready to tell me when I arrived . They refused to listen to my explanation that the dates overlapped when I flew from Canada to Rome and that I had made the reservation for the date that I flew out . They had all my e - mail correspondence printed out and basically instead of the . warm welcome . they promise on their website I received a. you were supposed to be here yesterday . thrown in my face . They cut me off mid - sentence more than 1 2 dozen times when I tried to explain to them what had happened and that I was willing to pay for the extra night . They showed absolutely no NOT_respect NOT_to NOT_me as a human being . never mind the fact that I was a guest . I am not NOT_an NOT_unreasonable NOT_person . and having worked as management in the hotel industry myself . I fully understand the process of compromising with a guest to ensure that they leave happy yet at the same time protecting the hotel from unnecessary loss . The hotel was not NOT_full NOT_during NOT_our NOT_stay . and they still charged me the full rate for the night . In my experience . if we had a guest 's flight information . it is natural to ensure the check - in date corresponds with the arrival date . While the airport transfer company gave me a discount as a penalty for the miscommunication . which I was totally appreciative of .   the hotel did nothing but make me feel small and insignificant . I respect that they may do things differently in Europe than in North America . but the attitude was totally uncalled for The only joy I got from staying at this hotel was eating breakfast . The gentleman who served us was one of TWO nice people I came across during my stay . the other was housekeeping .   I would advise that you should only stay at this hotel if it were the very very last hotel available . Do not NOT_make NOT_any NOT_mistakes NOT_with NOT_your NOT_reservation . and minimize contact with the front desk staff . And last but not NOT_least . do not NOT_be NOT_deceived NOT_by NOT_their . friendly . e - mail correspondence . it is all fake .", "The summer of 00 ' was n't NOT_a NOT_very NOT_good NOT_one NOT_for NOT_devout NOT_cinephiles . It offered no NOT_blair NOT_witches NOT_or NOT_sixth NOT_senses ; NOT_the NOT_best NOT_big NOT_budget NOT_hollywood NOT_could NOT_do NOT_was NOT_an NOT_efficient NOT_x - NOT_men NOT_adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . Nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery - charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o ' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : \" quality \" films ) compete for audiences . Alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season . It 's also indie director neil labute 's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i 'm sad to report it 's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that 's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute 's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic . I went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it 's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment . Are critics so desperate for something unique that they 're blind to how derivative the particular brand of \" uniqueness \" betty dolls out is ? For the first time labute is working from a script he has not NOT_written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . Betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [ stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie ] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation . It 's labute 's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he does n't even seem to have half that heart in it . Nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . She happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . She 's blocked out her husband 's death and thinks she 's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . Betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not NOT_so NOT_close NOT_pursuit . The labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not NOT_much ) NOT_with NOT_his NOT_sophomore NOT_effort , NOT_your NOT_friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . The play demonstrated no NOT_forward NOT_movement as an artist , only labute 's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things \" average \" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . In the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim \" boys will be boys \" . Another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! What was once so powerful about labute 's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . Obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty is n't NOT_it . He clearly has little passion for what he 's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger had n't NOT_managed NOT_to NOT_transcend NOT_that ) NOT_tailor NOT_made NOT_to NOT_appeal NOT_to NOT_the NOT_widest NOT_possible NOT_audience . Nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft - boiled tarantino - esque dialogue . They evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that 's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . I think rock is a great comic yet he has n't NOT_been NOT_able NOT_to NOT_bring NOT_his NOT_feral NOT_intelligence NOT_to NOT_movies , NOT_whenever NOT_he NOT_acts , and no NOT_matter NOT_the NOT_part , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_like NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_doing NOT_the NOT_damn NOT_chris NOT_rock NOT_show . Surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . That wide - open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not NOT_fully NOT_grown NOT_into NOT_her NOT_thirty - NOT_year - NOT_old NOT_body . It 's the best work she 's ever done . Freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . The actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty 's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . That 's interesting but the movie does n't NOT_do NOT_anything NOT_with NOT_it NOT_other NOT_than NOT_crash NOT_land NOT_the NOT_sub - NOT_theme NOT_into NOT_a NOT_labored NOT_speech NOT_in NOT_the NOT_midst NOT_of NOT_a NOT_badly NOT_staged NOT_gun NOT_battle . The film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie 's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing NOT_jells , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_parts , NOT_good NOT_or NOT_bad , NOT_are NOT_so NOT_disparate as to be opposing . The film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . Betty 's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty would n't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_progress NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film . Nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim 's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim 's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think . Betty has an interesting theme , though it does n't even seem aware of this . The current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . This is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real - life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . Instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the ' 80s than the ' 00s ) , the film simply uses betty 's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b. no NOT_progress NOT_is NOT_made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .", "The setting of this book is beautiful , exotic , and interesting .

Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck 's sexual references . Throughout the novel , Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter ( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest , for example ) .

The following review contains some harsh language * * * The blair witch project . Quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time . If you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace , because this movie is not NOT_scary NOT_or even remotely creepy . My colleague and friend chuck dowling wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmakers must have thought that nothing NOT_is NOT_more . And this worked for him . Well , i 'm sorry , but nothing ... Is nothing ! ! ! ! ! NOT_Nothing NOT_is NOT_not NOT_more . It 's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . I do not NOT_pay NOT_5 NOT_dollars NOT_to NOT_see NOT_nothing . \" nothing \" NOT_is NOT_free , NOT_available NOT_all NOT_around NOT_the NOT_world NOT_at NOT_a NOT_location NOT_near NOT_you . I am absolutely in amazement that some people find this movie scary . I could just discount them and say , \" well , i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are probably scared of their own shadow . \" But i have intelligent friends who like this movie and so that does n't NOT_hold NOT_water . There must be some other reason . ( then again , maybe my first thought is correct , i think i 'll try pointing their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) When i hear people praising this film , i never hear them talking about what makes up about 97 % of this movie : three kids bickering with each other about being lost . They only talk about what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time . This being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds and another where they shout \" josh ! ! \" Over and over . This film should not NOT_be NOT_called NOT_the NOT_blair NOT_witch NOT_project , NOT_it NOT_should NOT_more NOT_accurately NOT_be NOT_called NOT_three NOT_dumb and pisspoor filmmakers get lost ... And argue with each other . Oh ladies and gentlemen you will be so scared when you hear them shouting \" josh ! ! \" . And if you thought that was scary , wait till you see a pile of rocks , and then some tinkertoy lincoln logs , oh my dear lord you will be pissing in your pants with fear . Oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpacks . You 've never seen terror like this folks , and you do n't NOT_want NOT_to . The chevy chase / goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film . ( for current films , i highly recommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes for a creepy filmgoing experience . ) This film is an example of marketing with no NOT_substance . The marketing was brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film . They want this film to be good . And i think they are reaching and praising the wrong movie because they do n't NOT_have NOT_anything NOT_else NOT_to NOT_praise . That wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along , but this is not NOT_it . This film could have been so much better . Just think , if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost , and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff . I saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it . She was sold on this film . And then , at one point during it , she turned to me and asked ' ... are We supposed to be scared by this ? ' . I 've heard one opinion that you \" have to use your imagination \" to create the fear in this movie . Well , i thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed to do . Use their imagination and create a good movie . I mean anyone can use their imagination and not NOT_pay NOT_5 NOT_bucks NOT_for NOT_it . But even if you like this idea , then what are you imagining ? An entity called the blair witch ? Some rednecks fucking with these kids ? Are either of these things really scary when you think about it ? ? ? I 've heard several people say that this movie makes them recall how scary it can be to be out in the woods and hear something . Well sure that s scary in real life , but there are a lot of things that are scary in real life that are not NOT_scary NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_nor even interesting . You could sit in your house and see a snake or a spider and it could be scary , but in a film it would n't NOT_be . And no , NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_does NOT_not NOT_need NOT_a NOT_big NOT_budget NOT_or NOT_cgi NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_to NOT_be NOT_scary NOT_or NOT_creepy . Actually the less the better ( see the equally awful remake of the haunting ) . But you have to do something . You ca nt just count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary , if it were real . And by the way , about the shakycam filming in blair witch . Are n't NOT_these NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be \" NOT_filmmakers \" NOT_who NOT_should NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_point NOT_a NOT_camera and shoot something without NOT_shaking NOT_the NOT_camera NOT_constantly ? NOT_I NOT_'m NOT_not even talking about the couple scenes where they are terrified , that 's justified . I 'm talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they ca n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_shoot NOT_anything NOT_smoothly NOT_at NOT_all . Minor quibble there . There is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers . That the filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank . And i think there is a good chance they will see this film again and say to themselves \" what was i thinking ? ? \" . But , if they do n't , NOT_then NOT_that NOT_s NOT_fine . If it works for them then that 's okay i guess . I just lament that by making this movie a hit , we are going to be subjected to more of the \" nothing NOT_is NOT_more \" NOT_approach . Pretty soon we 're going to get some movies like this : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . For 90 minutes . And we 'll have to use our imagination and think to ourselves , \" my god , would n't NOT_it NOT_be NOT_scary NOT_to NOT_spend NOT_life NOT_in NOT_prison ? ! ! NOT_This NOT_movie NOT_is NOT_the NOT_scariest NOT_movie NOT_of NOT_all NOT_time ! ! ! ! ! \" .

Unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin 's newest film , ` patch adams , ' does n't NOT_have NOT_anywhere NOT_near NOT_the NOT_same NOT_impact . From the surface ` patch adams ' looks very promising . It 's a story about a not NOT_so NOT_young NOT_man , NOT_patch NOT_adams ( NOT_robin NOT_williams ) , NOT_who NOT_finds NOT_meaning NOT_in NOT_his NOT_life NOT_through NOT_helping NOT_sick NOT_people . When the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital . In a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of ` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it 's here that he finds how much he loves working with people . So he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school . Right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable . He continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry . Shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) . They , along with patch 's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people . Once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he ca n't NOT_graduate and kicks him out of school . Patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court . It 's here where the not NOT_so NOT_climatic NOT_court NOT_room NOT_battle NOT_takes NOT_place , NOT_over NOT_whether NOT_or NOT_not NOT_patch NOT_can NOT_become NOT_a NOT_real NOT_doctor . I have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it . It seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full - length movie . Considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother . Not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_of NOT_how NOT_serious NOT_the NOT_film NOT_takes NOT_itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama . Robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels . But those moments are rare and in the end ` patch adams ' is barely NOT_average .", "It seems that i 've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch . Take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like . However , it 's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood 's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies . It was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie is n't NOT_his NOT_own . Mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he did n't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_ending and had another director reshoot it . What a crock . If you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for . Why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , NOT_i NOT_changed NOT_my NOT_mind , NOT_i NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_like NOT_the NOT_ending . You 're fired . Let 's get someone else to do it . - i suppose honor is dead in hollywood . The end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized . Which is to say that it 's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize . In this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson 's prize is a blond and money . I miss originality in film , i really do . I think audiences are so starved for it that they 'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original . Payback 's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth . While gibson 's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , would n't NOT_kill NOT_in NOT_front NOT_of NOT_children and protects his blond woman . There 's nothing NOT_bad NOT_about NOT_him - NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_a NOT_hollywood NOT_character , NOT_a NOT_person NOT_who NOT_could NOT_never NOT_exist NOT_in NOT_real NOT_life . And gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a \" bad guy \" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant . The story involves gibson being double - crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $ 70 , 000 . Gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no NOT_more , NOT_no NOT_less . He makes a point of it that it 's strictly 70 grand . A real bad guy would have made his ex - partner pay 25 % interest . This idea is completely stretched out . Gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with . What i did n't NOT_understand - NOT_this NOT_is NOT_the NOT_chicago NOT_mafia . $ 70 , 000 is like spare change to them . They 'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him . I think they 'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $ 70 , 000 . Maybe i 'm being too hard on the movie . Perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie . I read roger ebert 's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy . That 's why we 're allowed to root for him . And it 's true - gibson walks the movie as if he 's smiling at a joke he just heard . But he 's wrong here . I wanted a lee marvin or old - time clint eastwood or somebody who was n't NOT_a NOT_comic , NOT_just NOT_an NOT_ass NOT_kicker . As a side note , i 've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback . After this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ? Really , i do n't NOT_care .

The subtitle , \" In Search of Grace O'Malley and Other Legendary Women of the Sea , \" makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of Grace O'Malley , with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers . Not NOT_so . The first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself , and Sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information . I knew almost nothing NOT_about NOT_Grace NOT_O'Malley NOT_going NOT_into NOT_the NOT_book , and I know little more than that now . The other women included are discussed in even sparer detail , and most of them are n't even real historical figures , but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids . She even talks about Pippi Longstocking ! Not NOT_what NOT_I NOT_was NOT_expecting NOT_at NOT_all ... \"The Pirate Queen \" is actually devoted far more to Sjoholm 's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself . I learned more about Sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study . She describes the inns she stayed at , the weather , the tourists she met , her own childhood , the abundance of \" personal bath mats \" in northern European hotels ... almost everything but Grace O'Malley and her cohorts . In fact , the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from Wilson to Sjoholm ; a story which , to be quite honest , I really could n't NOT_care NOT_less NOT_about . I bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures . It turned out to be a travel memoir , and a comparatively uninteresting one at that . This is a shame , really . Sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - Grace O'Malley herself , Bessie Millie , Janet Forsyth , Christian Robertson , Eliza Fraser , Isobel Gunn , Betty Mouat , Freydis Eiriksdottir , Skipper Thuridur , Trouser - Beret , Alfhild , the \" herring lassies , \" and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite , but then fails to deliver a full , satisfying portrait of any of them . She raises more questions than she answers , and I 'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information . You may also notice , given the names , that nearly all the women mentioned are northern European in origin . Sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world , such as the famous pirates Anne Bonney and Mary Read who , though from Europe , sailed the Caribbean . As for Sjoholm 's writing style , the book is an easy read , but not NOT_a NOT_very NOT_enjoyable NOT_one . Sjoholm 's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors . For example : \" The lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates , walnuts , and chocolate chips . In the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola \" ( pg . 222 ) . Flowery , gratuitous , and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph ... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin , you might say ... It 's not NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_book NOT_I NOT_'ve NOT_ever NOT_read , but I do wish I 'd spent my money on something else .

Admittedly , I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball .   So I 'm nostalgic , \" IT 'S A FREE COUNTRY . \"   It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels .   Yet , whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has \" matured , \" I can do nothing but cringe .   Here 's the flowchart :   Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub . - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets \" coached \" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new \" mature \" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process . Gee , I sure hope this is n't NOT_how NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_BR5 - NOT_49 NOT_comes NOT_about , but enough of the doom and gloom of impending implosion .   This record is OK .   Of course , I realize that any band ca n't NOT_just NOT_re - NOT_hash NOT_the NOT_same ' NOT_ol NOT_stuff NOT_on NOT_every NOT_album , but part of what got these guys so much early attention was the raw exhuberance they displayed both live and on the vinyl .   One part of this was their ability to do cover songs usually better than the originals , and a simple taste of this is what I sorely miss in the last few recordings .   This band live used to be a wild , jittery , moving organism on stage , and although they are still a solid live show ( saw them on the last tour at Poor David 's Pub in Dallas ) , something has settled down . Chuck is a great talent , but an early appeal of the band was the vocal volley of Chuck and Gary Bennett .

The last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? boring . I can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt . You do get all of the \" so bad they 're good \" traits so normally associated with the franchise . But you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot . It 's a deal i was n't NOT_willing NOT_to NOT_accept . Hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimura 's script crams in way too many details , and in many cases , fails to follow up on them . The maneuver is not NOT_only NOT_disconcerting , but gives the movie a permanent logy , weighty feel . Godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops . Was it a whim ?

When the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you , godzilla 2000 does the job - it 's entertaining and goes down easy . The action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish . The dubbing is nice and awful , with murata sounding like he 's in constant need of a cough drop . As for the dialogue , one line summarizes the goofiness factor : \" did anyone see that flying rock go by ? \" This movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that i 've heard the word \" imbecile \" used in casual conversation .

Twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . Eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without NOT_any NOT_laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . Whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die - hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team . Coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount . The dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team . The winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach . The knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops . Incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning .

The script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year 's \" pitch black , \" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood - thirsty , marauding aliens . In the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . Grier , pill - poppin ' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch \" desolation \" williams - that 's ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . But when they 're besieged by demented , zombie - like , body - snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . It seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long - dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as \" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , \" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . Carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the \" night of the living dead \" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . But you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . On the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" ghosts of mars \" thuds to a laborious , bottom - of - the - barrel 1 . Perhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet . \"", "I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap - Metal / Rock - Rap was Dead .

There 's not NOT_much NOT_more NOT_to NOT_this NOT_visually NOT_stylish NOT_film NOT_than NOT_what NOT_meets NOT_the NOT_eye , as it relies on shock to tell its story of a prolonged vicious mugging . It falls into the category of being a pretentious art - house film , leaving a bitter taste in one 's mouth as it stereotypes its characters and unintentionally further inflames the racial issues . It tries to make a heavy - handed point about disenfranchised black youths trapped by their environment , with their only way out being crime . But the story is so filled with violence and its nyc setting looks like hell , that it 's hard to enjoy this film and to follow what the logic in the story is supposed to mean . The relationship between the black mugger and his white victim is a cloudy one , which the film never determines what it wants to say about it . Matt mahurin is virtual one - man crew in putting this film together ( director / writer /cinematographer / editor ) , who is a still photographer in his day job . The film works best as a visually challenging piece , as each shot looks like a photograph carefully telling the story unfolding . A white photographer ( robert knepper ) is mugged by a black gang while he 's on a freelance assignment to take a photo shoot of harlem at night . He becomes a victim of amnesia and his head is bloodied as he 's left in a deserted harlem building , as the gang leaves him for dead ; but , one of the muggers , rumor ( michael williams ) , comes back and pretends to help him .

He enters the photographer 's stylish greenwich village apartment and steals his expensive camera , and decides to hold the mugging vic for ransom when he finds out he has a black girlfriend , stella ( belinda becker ) . She 's the only one in the film who could act . The film is stuck with a clumsy dialogue and an overuse of symbolism , as it ends with nothing NOT_more NOT_to NOT_tell NOT_after NOT_the NOT_shock and the violent situation it created except to beat it into the ground . It could only be commended for how appealing the film looks , as if it 's a scrapbook of still photos put together to celebrate a mugging .", "One of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , \" you 'd better watch out for the skin deep . \" I 'd like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do do n't NOT_watch NOT_skin NOT_deep . Skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards . John ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big - time drinking problem . I never saw edwards ' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake . You see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets . As the movie opens , zach 's wife , alex , catches him with not NOT_only NOT_his NOT_mistress but also his mistress ' hairdresser . Like any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him . In response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self - discovery . If you 're turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley . Skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters . Zach is a rich , ' 80s l. a. version of ritter 's jack tripper character from \" three 's company . \" Like jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he 's the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye . Zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him . Consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis . In fact , when zach crashes his ex - wife 's wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony . To add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work . For instance , vincent gardenia 's talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender . Of all the women in the film -- and there are many -- alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach 's wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role .

The comedy in skin deep does n't NOT_fare NOT_much NOT_better . Most of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish . About every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight - gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of \" dueling \" condoms . Overall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat . My final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism . Zach 's excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain . Zach 's drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences . If he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one . If he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail . If his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he 'll clean up his act . The tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no NOT_joking NOT_matter . Perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep .", "This record kind of sucks , but that 's okay , because it does n't NOT_suck NOT_in NOT_the NOT_way NOT_where NOT_you NOT_think & NOT_quot;oh NOT_hell NOT_we NOT_'ll NOT_never NOT_get NOT_a NOT_good NOT_album NOT_out NOT_of NOT_this NOT_guy NOT_again&quot ; ( NOT_like , NOT_for NOT_instance , NOT_Rod NOT_Stewart NOT_'s NOT_latest NOT_garbage ) , NOT_because , NOT_I NOT_think , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_not NOT_really NOT_Lou NOT_'s NOT_fault .

Roughly one fourth of the book pertains to clothing , the other three fourths talk about :              how to properly hold your drawing implement , how to properly position yourself if you are drawing                                  from a live modle , maintaing a daily sketchbook , researching your subject matter , the relationships between        the head neck and shoulders , drawing hands , drawing feet , drawing eyes , and a whole slew of other . . .I would n't NOT_say NOT_irrelavent , NOT_because NOT_they NOT_are NOT_relavent , but not NOT_neccessarily NOT_the NOT_most NOT_important NOT_topics NOT_pertaining NOT_to NOT_drawing NOT_the NOT_clothed NOT_figure . A refernce guide on clothing should discuss a plethora of clothing materials , and Bradley does on one page with chicken scratch detailing . It should outline some of the rules when dealing with how clothes tend to fit people of varying body tips , again something Bradley discusses on one single page . The differnce between water logged clothing and dry clothing , she did n't NOT_bother NOT_mentioning NOT_that . How pants typically bunch up while you 're walking seen from the head on , profile , three quaters , and back view , another topic she failed to mention . Some examples of evening/ formal attire vs. day clothes , how clothing reacts when the subject is in motion , how jackets restrain your actions and bunch up , the effect of wearing multiple layers at once , achieving that perfect windswept look , and all manner of other topics that should appear in an artistic clothing refernce guide . Maybe I 'm being too harsh on Bradley , after all she does mention in her preface that there are n't NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_lot NOT_of NOT_books NOT_pertain NOT_to NOT_drawing NOT_the NOT_clothed NOT_figure , and compared to the standard \" how to . . . \" books she 's leaps and bounds ahead of the rest . Oh yeah , that 's another thing , she does n't NOT_outline NOT_any NOT_steps NOT_on NOT_how NOT_to NOT_achieve NOT_a NOT_realistic NOT_rendering NOT_like- NOT_first NOT_start NOT_out NOT_with NOT_a NOT_cone NOT_pointing NOT_upward NOT_then NOT_draw NOT_a NOT_sphere NOT_at NOT_the NOT_bottom / NOT_base . The sphere represents the weight of the gathered cloth so the stress lines originate from the tip of the cone and travel down the length eventually enveloping the sphere . Note the ripples . -or some junk like that . Back to me not NOT_being NOT_to NOT_harsh NOT_on NOT_Bradley , NOT_I NOT_guess NOT_in NOT_reading NOT_she NOT_is / NOT_was NOT_a NOT_professor NOT_in NOT_the NOT_arts NOT_I NOT_thought NOT_she NOT_would NOT_have NOT_some NOT_understanding NOT_of NOT_the NOT_common NOT_impediments NOT_modern NOT_day NOT_artist NOT_face NOT_when NOT_depicting NOT_clothing . For all who have read this drawn out rant , two maybe three people , and think I 'm all talk , trust me if I had the skills I 'd come up with my own series of \" How to draw . . . \" books and address all of my issues . As is I 'm pretty good at drawing dynamic figures , but the second I add clothing they become flat , lifeless caricatures and I do n't NOT_see NOT_this NOT_book as alleviating my shortcomings much . As is my own artistic habits ( drawing from magazines , online pics , and occasionally stepping outside of my cave to draw people in motion ) are a match for the few helpful hints in this book . You 're better off doing what you 've always done plus artistically drapping to a wall or over a piece of furniture from time to time then buying this book . If you do know of a book that addresses even half of the afore mentioned topics , if you could write a review mentioning them , somehow recommend them to me or whatever I 'd be eternally in your debt", "Avoid Hotel Britannia .

Testament must have taken hints from Metallica and tried to attract a different audience .   This is not NOT_a NOT_horrible NOT_album , but compared to any other Testament album , it is easily their worst .   Only the die - hard Testament fan , or those into commercial metal should pick this up .", "This well - conceived but ultra sugary coming - of - age film is not NOT_for NOT_everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . Joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year - old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . Loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . The beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without NOT_being NOT_fanatical . The beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua 's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . This is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well - run catholic school . Joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well - meaning parents . All this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . The plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . His answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that 's just the way it is , sometimes . This search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he does n't NOT_exist . Now , that 's a smart kid . But joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . One of his teachers is the kind - hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean - up hitter , and in my opinion , if she was n't NOT_a NOT_big NOT_tv NOT_star , NOT_would NOT_have NOT_a NOT_vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . Throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) Question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . Nothing NOT_much NOT_happens NOT_in NOT_the NOT_search NOT_for NOT_god , NOT_there NOT_is NOT_no NOT_parody NOT_of NOT_the NOT_catholic NOT_school ; NOT_though NOT_a NOT_visiting NOT_cardinal NOT_is NOT_found NOT_by NOT_the NOT_boy NOT_not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_talk NOT_to NOT_god , but this is gentle stuff , no NOT_real NOT_criticism NOT_or NOT_search NOT_for NOT_god NOT_is NOT_attempted . What comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not NOT_to NOT_upset NOT_anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody - goody . The film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) Tells him his grandfather is all right . His quest is ended , as apparently angels do n't NOT_have NOT_wings and are approachable ; and god , well , ... Maybe that 's for another film down the road . This part of the film was the final straw for me , i could n't NOT_swallow NOT_any NOT_more NOT_goo . As this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . Though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . Well , god bless him , if he can do that . This is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . It 's just too bad that it had nothing NOT_relevent NOT_or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . And that family of his , they 're too good for words . Yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . For those who want to see something soft , without NOT_a NOT_bite NOT_to NOT_it , NOT_this NOT_is NOT_the NOT_one .", "Two party guys bob their heads to haddaway 's dance hit \" what is love ? \" While getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . It 's barely NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_sustain NOT_a NOT_three - NOT_minute _ NOT_saturday_night_live _ NOT_skit , but _ snl _ producer lorne michaels , _ clueless _ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution 's recurring \" roxbury guys \" sketch that would presumably make a good feature . Emphasis on the word \" presumably . \" _ a_night_at_the_roxbury _ takes an already - thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point -- and that of viewers ' patience levels . The first five minutes or so of _ roxbury _ play very much like one of the original \" roxbury guys \" skits . With \" what is love ? \" Blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out \" hotties \" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . There is one crucial difference , however -- these guys speak . That little fact has been used as justification for the film 's existence , that the butabis ' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . The doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that 's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . There is no NOT_story NOT_per NOT_se , NOT_only NOT_a NOT_loosely NOT_structured and linked series of subplots . The brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _ 21_jump_street _ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . There , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited -- can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . Meanwhile , the bros ' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . When doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . The narrative messiness of _ roxbury _ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none NOT_of NOT_it NOT_is . The assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . Alas , the joke -- a rather lazy takeoff on _ jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . Granted , a lot of people _ have _ seen _ jerry_maguire _ , but the fact that the film 's best joke is completely dependent on one 's familiarity with another film says a lot about _ roxbury _ 's lack of inspiration . That lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . Like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _ saturday_night_live _ , \" the roxbury guys \" is a one - joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . After watching one of the \" roxbury \" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to \" what is love ? \" , Bump unsuspecting women , and ... that 's all . After watching _ a_night_at_the_roxbury _ , you 'll be left with exactly the same .", "Only OK . My mom and I stayed at the Hotel Columbus for 3 nights last month each with a single room .

It does not NOT_surprise NOT_me NOT_in NOT_the NOT_least NOT_that NOT_a NOT_group NOT_of NOT_extremely NOT_talented NOT_actors , NOT_led NOT_by NOT_the NOT_great NOT_richard NOT_dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film . In fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf 's tribe as possible . In retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been . I shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss . Dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $ 100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea . Halfway into his two - year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies . I say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established . Later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big - screen tvs and other such pleasures . So , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not NOT_use NOT_their NOT_grant NOT_money NOT_wisely , NOT_he NOT_decides NOT_to NOT_construct NOT_an NOT_elaborate NOT_lie . He makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video . He simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) . Audiences at krippendorf 's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision . And proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community . Like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero . Dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film . He has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically . This film also requires a lot of physical humor that i 've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job . Jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf 's work , is also very funny and appealing here . And the kid actors are great , as well . But we 're talking about the script from hell . This is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen . But the ridiculousness of the story is not NOT_really NOT_what NOT_is NOT_so NOT_bad NOT_about NOT_it . All the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew . No , NOT_the NOT_script NOT_is NOT_plagued NOT_with NOT_so NOT_many NOT_clueless NOT_stereotypes and mean - spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched . Furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless . Take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex . They get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin . Krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe . Now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , \" no , NOT_that NOT_would NOT_be NOT_far NOT_too NOT_tasteless . There 's no NOT_way NOT_they NOT_'ll NOT_do NOT_that ... oh God ! \" They did do it . It 's there . I was almost more appalled by the fact that this did n't NOT_bother NOT_the NOT_other NOT_audience NOT_members NOT_with NOT_whom NOT_i NOT_saw NOT_this NOT_film . I found it deplorable . And when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without NOT_the NOT_slightest NOT_hint NOT_of NOT_conviction NOT_in NOT_his NOT_voice . The film is filled with scenes like these . They not NOT_only NOT_insult NOT_the NOT_audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays . It would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon . And watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on - screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes . If i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely . Moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes . Sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes . It is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film . His character here is not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_subject NOT_for NOT_a NOT_film NOT_because NOT_he NOT_is NOT_a NOT_shameless NOT_liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does . I suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something . No , NOT_this NOT_man NOT_sets NOT_a NOT_terrible NOT_example NOT_for NOT_his NOT_kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) did n't NOT_include NOT_a NOT_single NOT_scene NOT_in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad . In fact , it 's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings . I suppose it 's important to admit that this is a funny film . Dreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring . And if you 're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it . I , however , ca n't NOT_get NOT_past NOT_these NOT_elements . Krippendorf 's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they should n't NOT_be NOT_learning . With a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie .", "a huge disappointment . I 'm sorry . I do not NOT_agree NOT_with NOT_the NOT_favourable NOT_reviews NOT_on NOT_this NOT_site and found this hotel disappointing in every respect . It was a very long walk from the reception to our room . and the miserable . porter . who accompanied us only relieved us of the very smallest piece of hand luggage . leaving myself and my husband to trudge along after him for what seemed like hours . dragging all the rest without even a trolley - I have never experienced anything like it at a so - called 4-star hotel .

Then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female . He , of course , goes along with it . Gee , i wonder if they get together in the end . I 've seen more original stuff on the wb . And better stuff too .

I stayed at this hotel based on the reviews on TA and other websites and I was very disappointed . I love the details and quality of service of boutique hotels and hoped this one with its great location would be one to add to my list but sadly NO . First the positives location is magnificent . especially since my mother and I were staying for only three nights and going for shopping the location was perfect . we could drop some of the bags . start shopping the moment we stepped outside the hotel . it is also surrounded by several great cafes and rests . for lunch and dinner litterally steps away . Another positive was the size of the room . on check in we were informed that we were upgraded to a triple room . which was a pleasant surprise . the room is a spacious double room but in no NOT_way NOT_could NOT_accomodate NOT_three NOT_people . the wardrobe was very small though . it was clean and the windows are soundproof . no NOT_view NOT_at NOT_all NOT_one NOT_of NOT_the NOT_windows NOT_opened NOT_to NOT_plumbing . and the other opened to windows of other rooms where we could see and hear the other guests .

The conceirge is not NOT_very NOT_informative NOT_or NOT_knowledgable NOT_about NOT_rests . or reccomendations . I asked her about a couple of restaurants which were supposedly famous she did nt know them . when I asked her for reccomendation for a typical italian restaurant she said she had to think about it and call me back and when she did she reccomended a rest that was close but average at best . We had also requested the pick up service from the airport which turned out to be more expensive than a taxi . around 15 - 20 more euros . he was standing with a barely NOT_legible NOT_sign NOT_with NOT_our NOT_name NOT_we NOT_spent NOT_ten NOT_minutes NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_him . he drove while talking on the phone and alot of people were honking their horns at him for his driving AND he ran an errand while we were with him taking us on a detour to be able to do that .   The breakfast they informed us we could have in the breakfast room or in our room we opted for our room . but that was a horrific experience . the coffee tasted cold and ugly . the first and last ugly weird tasting coffee I had in Italy .   the croissant was not NOT_fresh . the honey was frozen . and the five jams they got us were all in one flavor . when I complained to the receptionist . I think she was surprised or did nt understand but the breakfast the next day was worse with the croissant worse then the first day and the same weird coffee I did nt have any breakfast and we ate it outside .

This film can be described in one sentence : obscene level of incompetence , excessive stupidity in the story line , gross negligence of the viewer 's intelligence , a prurient interest in the quick buck . Believe me , after an hour with these characters , acting and script , you 'll start hoping for someone to kill somebody . Elizabeth berkley makes a laughable try as the heroine of this film , that is bad even for eszterhas ' script .

Tony shalhoub , the smart - mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u. s. he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study . Although misha gets a few nice lines ( \" i 'm russian . I like long stories . \") , His somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy . Besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech - impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year - old hallie kate eisenberg . Naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart . The bad news is that her part is confined to the first half .

And when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing . \" it 's a long story , \" says paulie . \" it 's the only kind he knows , \" reflects misha .

Roger", "Tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi - tiered marketing materials for crap movies . And here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes . I did n't NOT_expect NOT_much NOT_from NOT_this NOT_latest \" NOT_interpretation \" NOT_of NOT_pierre NOT_boulle NOT_'s NOT_classic NOT_novel NOT_planet NOT_of NOT_the NOT_apes . I mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co - scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those \" damn dirty apes , \" in one of his best roles of his career ? Sadly , i sat down to watch burton 's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off . This time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x. marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u. s. air force pilot . Leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no NOT_real NOT_explanation NOT_given NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered \" smart \" chimps into the storms to collect data . Leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he 's thrown through some type of time - space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle . Leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) . The kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo 's ship . Along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth ! In the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip - off human versus ape battle scene . While rick baker 's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the \" surprise \" ending feels like a swing from a ball - peen hammer into the temple . Wahlberg does not NOT_have NOT_the NOT_physical NOT_or NOT_mental NOT_presence NOT_of NOT_a NOT_chuck NOT_heston NOT_to NOT_carry NOT_the NOT_film NOT_or NOT_any NOT_of NOT_its NOT_action NOT_sequences . This remake , or re - interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film . The ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human . Even chuck heston 's anti - gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey . But the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton . Even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film . Even joel schumacher could have directed this film . He probably should have . Burton 's predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one 's place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee - wee 's big adventure , are completely absent in this planet . I suppose that 's what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole .", "Would never stay here again .   There are three positive things about this place . which stop me from giving it a rating of terrible First . it has a good location . Second . it has better than average breakfast . for Italy . and third . it has a lovely and friendly staff . The hotel itself is greatly lacking . The worse problem is the noise . The rooms must have walls and ceilings of paper . You hear every walk . every word . every creak . all the time . Its incredibly hard to get any rest The second problem is that it is not NOT_very NOT_clean . The carpets are old . worn and dirty . the bed comforter left much to be desired .

My wife and I arrived in Rome late last Thursday night having booked this hotel on recomendation from a family member who had stayed there previously . When we got to reception they checked us in and then informed us that our room was not NOT_actually NOT_in NOT_the NOT_hotel NOT_itself . but in another building . close by .   A porter escorted us by foot to a building on Via Nacionale which is two or three blocks away from the hotel To get to the room we had to first unlock a door to get to a courtyard . then unlock a gate to get to the building . then another door to get to the hallway and finally the door to the room . This meant carrying a big bunch of keys around for the entire stay as there was no NOT_reception NOT_at NOT_this NOT_building NOT_In NOT_the NOT_room NOT_itself NOT_there NOT_was NOT_a NOT_small NOT_bathroom and a small bedroom . The view from the window . which was tiny . was the wall of another building less than ten feet away so very little light got into the room . The TV . advertised as satellite had one channel working and even this was hazy . Worst of all . when I picked up the phone to call the hotel to see if we could be moved to another room . we discovered the phone did not NOT_work NOT_either . Not even a dial tone on it Rather than let this ruin our trip to Rome we made the most of it and enjoyed our first three days of sightseeing . On our last evening we returned to the room to shower before heading out but when we attempted to leave we discovered that we were locked in . The door from the hallway to the top of the stairs had been locked from the outside and because there was no NOT_keyhole NOT_on NOT_the NOT_inside NOT_we NOT_were NOT_unable NOT_to NOT_get NOT_out .

After three fruitless conversations with the receptionist . who did not NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_know NOT_that NOT_we NOT_were NOT_actually NOT_staying NOT_at NOT_his NOT_hotel . and a thirty minute wait . finally someone arrived to open the door for us . By this time we had run out of patience so we packed our bags to go to the main hotel buliding and request to be moved to another room . I asked the porter to wait so we could go with him to the main hotel but when I came back with our bags he had gone . My wife and I had to drag our bags the three blocks back to the hotel at 10 pm on our last night in Rome When we got to the reception the porter who I had asked to wait for us was sitting next to the receptionist but had not even mentioned that we were looking to change rooms or that we were on our way I explained to the receptionist . who was also the night manager our issues with the room and the fact we were locked in and that if nothing NOT_else NOT_the NOT_safety NOT_issue NOT_of NOT_having NOT_a NOT_door NOT_that NOT_could NOT_be NOT_locked NOT_from NOT_the NOT_outside NOT_was NOT_scandalous NOT_for NOT_a NOT_reputable NOT_hotel . It was very obvious from our conversation that he had never even been to the building we were staying in . never mind the room . and he kept insisting that the hotel was fully booked and there was nothing NOT_he NOT_could NOT_do NOT_about NOT_it . I asked him to call his manager and he talked to him on the phone but the best solution they could come up with was a single room for the night . I looked at this room and there was barely NOT_enough NOT_room NOT_for NOT_one NOT_person NOT_in NOT_there . Luckily my wife had gone to the Bettoja Hotel Nord next door and they had a room available for 50 euro less than we were paying . The hotel manager insisted that I pay for my three nights stay in full which I did simply to just get out of there . Maybe the main hotel is beautiful . Maybe the staff are friendly and courteous . Maybe the breakfast is sensational .

Also added to the pointless proceedings is some would - be humorous shenanigans involving quinn 's dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) . With a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of ' 80s youth films and _ home_alone _ ) finally approach something close to a point . Turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes 's main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired \" live in the present and for the future \" message . Most moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time . Wide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill -- thus revealing the _ real _ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises .

Death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy . We expect these events . We know they 're going to happen and some , we even look forward to . It 's part of the human condition . We have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society . As we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face . Politicians exaggerate their own importance . Our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong . In the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares . In hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel . Even if the original story does n't NOT_merit NOT_one . Even if the first film is complete in itself . Even if success is a fluke . \" the blair witch project \" was made with a budget of $ 1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits . The concept was brilliant . The filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real . The film itself was even more convincing . The movie _ must _ be authentic . Why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? The first film caught lightning in a bottle . The sequel proves you ca n't NOT_pour NOT_that NOT_old NOT_lightning NOT_into NOT_a NOT_new NOT_bottle . You have to give this effort some credit . It would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids . It would have been easy , but of course , it would n't NOT_have NOT_worked . Instead \" book of shadows \" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release . It 's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel . Unfortunately it does n't NOT_work NOT_either . Five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film . Weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives . Even weirder stuff happens . Some people die , there 's blood and knives and none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_have NOT_a NOT_lick NOT_of NOT_common NOT_sense . While supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation . Then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music . It 's a bad plan . The cast shows some early promise . A couple is doing research on a \" blair witch \" book . The tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado . A goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief . The obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick . The first film 's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods . This time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors . There 's not NOT_one NOT_character NOT_you NOT_care NOT_about NOT_when NOT_they NOT_start NOT_shouting NOT_for NOT_no NOT_reason . Although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it 's ruined by poor execution . The follow - up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_slasher NOT_movie . They 're trapped in an old big weird house . They stupidly separate into various rooms . There are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear . Ever see this movie ? Seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better . The film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore . For a storyline filled with surprises , it 's oddly predicable . \" the blair witch project \" was a rare triumph of style over substance . \" the book of shadows \" is a triumph of tedium over promise .", "Disappointed with the Visconti .

We booked a double non - smoking room and were given a twin smoking room . apart from that the accomodation was satisfactory The hotel has a bar and serves light food which is a bonus in Rome . it also has a pleasant outdoor patio area . however it was not NOT_welcoming .

This was poor value for money and I certainly would not NOT_recommend NOT_staying NOT_here NOT_when NOT_there NOT_are NOT_so NOT_many NOT_other NOT_hotel and appartment choices . we spent the minimum time in our hotel as we felt so uncomfortable and unwelcomed there . the atmosphere was dire .", "Midway through \" anaconda \" , documentary filmmaker terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) turns to a co - worker and says \" i thought this movie would be my first big break . Instead , it 's turned into a disaster . \" Truer words have never been spoken . \" anaconda \" is a monster movie with a lousy monster . It 's a suspense film that is utterly predictable . It 's a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares , but only in the most elementary way , like a jack - in - the - box . As you turn the crank , you 're totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up , but somehow it 's still mildly startling when it happens . The main difference between the giant snake in \" anaconda \" and the clown in a jack - in - the - box is that the clown is more realistic . \" anaconda \" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years . Animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe- inducing robots you 've endured at disney world . But it 's the computer animated scenes that truly expand the meaning of the word lame . In one shot , a character tries to flee from the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall , but the giant snake springs out and loops around its hapless victim in mid air . The scene , if done well , would have been a jaw- dropper . Here , the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon . What 's really amazing is that the filmmaker 's were so proud of this dreadful shot that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie . But enough about the phony snakes . Now it 's time to talk about the lousy story . Heroic and very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search of the shirishama indians , a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in the boondocks of the rain forest . Stoltz tells his crew \" pray that you did n't NOT_forget NOT_your NOT_bug NOT_spray . \" Apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff , because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops and short shorts with no NOT_ill NOT_effect . Along the way , the group rescues a whacked - out lapsed priest ( jon voight ) who claims to know how to find the shirishama . Within minutes , they throw away all their plans and follow voight down a tributary into the land of creepiness . From that point on , the film is a hodgepodge of scenes and shots ripped off from \" jaws \" and \" dead calm . \" One of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz . Early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious . So why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ? Also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ? Ah , the mysteries of hollywood . The remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen . Jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters . Lopez , who starred in \" selena , \" is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible . Ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously . There 's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he 's gently mocking his own tough - guy posturing . But the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight . Obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of \" jonny quest . \" At one point , he looms over the crew and says \" the anaconda is the perfect killing machine . It strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love . And you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode . \" that moment is so high - camp that it almost made the film tolerable . Almost . Fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out \" anaconda . \" Do n't . There are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer , including another \" alien \" sequel . Wait for them , rent \" jaws \" in the meantime , and do n't NOT_throw NOT_away NOT_your NOT_money and time on drivel like this .", "Awful Hotel . do not NOT_bother .

We had topay extra money and spend more time to arrive in town The hotel replied with a simple email . sorry fully booked . nothing NOT_more . not even we apologize or we will help you find another place .

Well to start this off i 'd just like to say a couple things . First is , i miss michael keaton , i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence . Not even from the first film was batman really the ' star ' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway . In ' batman forever ' and now in ' batman & robin ' he 's almost pushed to being a bit player . I ca n't NOT_really NOT_say NOT_if NOT_clooney ( NOT_who NOT_regardless NOT_was NOT_better NOT_than NOT_kilmer ) NOT_was NOT_a NOT_very NOT_good NOT_batman NOT_or NOT_not . He 's given next to nothing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_at NOT_all , NOT_he NOT_might as well not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_there and it would n't NOT_have NOT_made NOT_much NOT_difference . Now , joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wo nt make batman brooding and dark . Fine , i mean granted ' batman returns ' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes . Yet his bright neon , campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me . I 'm usually very easy on films . I loved ' con air ' and other films some critics have slammed . Granted that film really was paper thin , cliche ridden , except for one thing , it was fun . There is virtually no NOT_fun NOT_in NOT_this NOT_film NOT_at NOT_all . I could n't NOT_have NOT_cared NOT_less . It 'll thrill the little ones as there s no NOT_violence NOT_really , NOT_none NOT_everyone NOT_comes NOT_out NOT_fine NOT_in NOT_the NOT_end NOT_like NOT_those NOT_old NOT_tv NOT_shows NOT_where NOT_it NOT_ends NOT_with NOT_everyone NOT_laughing . Schwarzenegger is awful , i mean really , really bad ... And this is coming from a regular fan of his work . I love his movies most of the time and the basic reason is he never says much in any of them . He talks all to often in this movie . I would have much prefered to have seen patric stewart in the roll . I believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone in a film . I liked alfred but the reason behind it is a cheap shot .", "The kids in the hall are an acquired taste . It took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . Maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . My recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . As it is , their first -- and most likely only -- attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . A big - budget and glossy production can not NOT_make NOT_up NOT_for NOT_a NOT_lack NOT_of NOT_spontaneity NOT_that NOT_permeates NOT_their NOT_tv NOT_show . The kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they are nt really having fun doing so . And this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . Brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . In typical sketch - comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . Doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . Then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . The ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . At about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . The best thing about sketch comedy -- and the kids are no NOT_exception -- NOT_is NOT_the NOT_ability NOT_to NOT_quickly NOT_deliver NOT_the NOT_laughs , NOT_then NOT_go NOT_on NOT_to NOT_another NOT_quick NOT_skit . But with the additional set - up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just do nt come fast enough . Strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . The movie makes several attempts at risqueness -- mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters -- but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . One of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle -- going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . In the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . The kids , unfortunately , are not NOT_up NOT_to NOT_the NOT_task . There are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_experience NOT_an NOT_enjoyable NOT_one .", "Good in parts . but mostly disappointing . Our experience at the Melia was mixed . The main negative aspect of staying here is clearly the remoteness from the centre of Rome . The shuttle bus is quite big and spacious . but simply does not NOT_run NOT_enough NOT_journeys NOT_during NOT_the NOT_day . And the fact that there are no NOT_runs NOT_into NOT_town NOT_between NOT_5 NOT_30pm and 9 pm makes it impossible to return to the hotel for an afternoon rest and then go back into Rome for an evening meal - quite unacceptable . Infact . the shuttle bus times seem to be designed to suit the driver . not NOT_the NOT_hotel NOT_guests . The superior room we had was on the top . 6th . floor . overlooking the back . so was fairly quiet . with only minor background traffic noise from a road some distance away . Unfrotunately the bed was rock hard and very uncomfortable for those who - like myself - are of bigger size . Fortunately . there was a sofa - bed in the room . and that was actually more comfortable . The TV channels had only two that were English speaking . CNN and Euronews . The third one - that was not NOT_working - NOT_was NOT_Sky NOT_News . Quite unbelievable for a 4 star hotel . Although we stayed in March . when the weather was already quite mild . the heating was switched on at full power . and the corridors of the hotel floors were oppressively hot . Predicatbly . the hotel rooms had no NOT_access NOT_to NOT_air NOT_conditioning . only heating . Quite absurd . given Rome 's balmy mediterrenean location . the The other negative feature is the apparent unreliability of the alarm call service . We booked a wake up call for 8 20am on the morning of our departure . and the call arrived at 6 20am - a rude awakening . to put it mildly On the positive side . the hotel restaurant was extremely good - one of the best I have ever tried . The food was simply wonderful . from beginning to the end . and the service of a very good standard . I certainly did not NOT_find NOT_the NOT_restaurant NOT_too NOT_formal . simply polite and respectful - after all this is a 4 star hotel and not NOT_Butlins . We chose the special four course set dinner and were charged 76 Euros for the the two of us .   discounted from 84 Euros . - I consider that to represent excellent value for money . Certainly not NOT_expensive . given that this must be one of the best restaurants in Rome . The breakfast in the morning was also quite good . with a lot of choice . although the service was chaotic . The only let down - and this was quite a serious one - was the lack of proper bacon and sausages - they only offered a very thinly cut fried pancetta and some tasteless boiled frankfurters . And the scrambled eggs were obviously fried with oil rather than butter - this made them greasy and not NOT_very NOT_tasty . So the cooked part of the breakfast is totally inadequate for an Anglo - Saxon clientele . though the rest of it was actually very nice . with plenty of fruit . yoghurts and croissants of every type Overall . the hotel was a great disappointment and I will not NOT_consider NOT_staying NOT_there NOT_again . The restaurant was the only high point . everything else a let down . My overall impression is that this hotel is well suited to Italian business people but not NOT_for NOT_foreign NOT_tourists NOT_seeking NOT_a NOT_pleasant NOT_stay .", "I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller , but I plan to in the near future .   Having said that , I have no NOT_idea NOT_how NOT_this NOT_compares , but I did n't NOT_really NOT_care NOT_for NOT_it .   It 's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I could n't NOT_get NOT_into .   I felt like I was reading a teen or children 's book , and I do n't NOT_like NOT_feeling NOT_so NOT_patronized NOT_when NOT_I NOT_read NOT_unless NOT_I NOT_knowingly NOT_pick NOT_up NOT_a NOT_picture NOT_book NOT_ready NOT_for NOT_the NOT_simplicity NOT_of NOT_a NOT_good NOT_message -- even then , I do n't NOT_usually NOT_feel NOT_patronized NOT_or \" NOT_written NOT_down NOT_to \" .   It 's simple writing and a simple plot .   It 's lighthearted and thus a light read .   I imagine many people would enjoy it ; I just could n't NOT_get NOT_into NOT_it .   :o", "I wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world . And i wish that film - makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _ not _ NOT_to NOT_do NOT_it . Writer / director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul - searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country - western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning . Convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every \" thou shalt not \" NOT_of NOT_the NOT_ten NOT_commandments NOT_into NOT_a \" NOT_thou NOT_shalt \" ( and vice versa ) . His wife 's sister rachel ( \" friends \" ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel 's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic . Thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion . Taplitz is n't NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_treating NOT_seth NOT_'s NOT_tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him . Composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth 's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn 's performance as seth is all wild - eyed fervor without NOT_any NOT_genuine NOT_pain . The actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five - minute montage . The result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high - concept movie plot . It 's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth . Corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no NOT_indication NOT_she NOT_has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth 's \" false witness . \" Only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve . Even she ca n't NOT_force NOT_taplitz NOT_to NOT_decide NOT_whose NOT_story NOT_this NOT_is , NOT_or NOT_what NOT_we NOT_should NOT_have NOT_learned NOT_about NOT_dealing NOT_with NOT_the NOT_struggles NOT_in NOT_our NOT_lives and our relationship with the infinite . By the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no NOT_connection NOT_with NOT_real NOT_human NOT_experience . Commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously .", "I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD , Demon Days . The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so \" out there \" that when you first hear one of their CD's ... it sounds like complete garbage . But once you listen again and again , you start to like it more and more . Eventually you end up really liking the CD . That was the case with Demon Days . After enjoying that CD fully , I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD , and   I did n't NOT_like NOT_it NOT_all NOT_that NOT_much . There just seems to be very little actual songs on the CD . Way too much of it sounds like complete filler . There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days , but most of the stuff on that CD was great . Here , we 've got songs that are just ... boring . Nothing NOT_happens . I was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs , but it never happens . You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background . ( Such as on songs like New Genious , Man Research , and Starshine . ) Some songs are nothing but beats with no NOT_lyrics NOT_at NOT_all , NOT_sometimes NOT_sounding NOT_just NOT_like NOT_static NOT_noise . Songs like this , such as Double Bass , are cool for a minute or two , but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes . It gets boring . Other songs , like 5/4 , M1 A1 , and Rock the House are catchy at first , but just do n't NOT_have NOT_staying NOT_power . They get old . 5/4 got annoying quickly , M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal quickly , and Rock the House is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it . And songs like Latin Simone are just annoying . The remixes of 19 - 2000 and Clint Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable , although 19 - 2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens . There are some good songs here , though . Tomorrow Comes Today , Clint Eastwood , Gravity , 19 - 2000 , and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool songs . Slow Country 's kind of cool , too . And Dracula 's got an awesome , almost haunting sound to it , and it 's really absorbing . Although it too , unfortuantely , loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it . This small collection of good songs , though , is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks . Much of this CD just is n't NOT_really NOT_that NOT_good . I do n't NOT_know ... this CD just seemed empty . Very few meaningful tracks , lots of filler , and some really annoying and repetitive songs . Some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long , mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs . Clocking in at 72 minutes , ( which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than Demon Days ) this CD was loaded with filler and just not NOT_enough NOT_good NOT_stuff . People interested in The Gorillaz should pick up their superior follow - up , Demon Days , instead of this one . If I listened to this debut CD first , I probably would n't NOT_have NOT_ended NOT_up NOT_liking NOT_this NOT_band NOT_very NOT_much . The good news about this is that the Gorillaz have not NOT_hit NOT_a NOT_sophmore NOT_slump ; NOT_their NOT_CDs NOT_are NOT_getting NOT_better , NOT_not NOT_worse .

Like some of the other reviewers . we were put in a tiny single room with a less than average sized double bed and no NOT_room NOT_to NOT_move NOT_around . I asked why when I 'd reserved a. standard . room the room was smaller than the majority in the hotel . checking the fire escape plans on each floor made this clear to me .   and was eventually upgraded but the hotel blamed the website we had booked with . In atmosphere . service and facilities it 's basically a youth hostel that has been done up with some cheap gimmicks . the CDs . the stereos - more Hitachi than Bang .   Olufson . rubber flooring in the hallways .   Definitely not NOT_4 NOT_star . The garden is lovely . but there 's no NOT_bar NOT_or NOT_cafe NOT_service NOT_after NOT_you NOT_return NOT_from NOT_a NOT_hard NOT_day NOT_'s NOT_sightseeing . so its usefulness as a place to relax is quite diminished . Paying for a 4 star hotel . and then having to wander the streets to get a snack for my sick co - traveller was not NOT_ideal . Yes . its very close to the Vatican but in a down - at - heel Roman neighbourhood with few joys to be found roaming the local streets . so once you have done the Vatican the rest of your trip will be a hassle of taxis . metro and 30 - 40 minute walks . Unlike one of the reviews I read above . I thought the photos were very unrepresentative of the reality of the hotel . It 's cramped throughout . not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_tiny NOT_rooms . and throughout our . mercifully brief . stay . there always seemed to be some staff drama going on . doing the accounts in reception on the guest seating - come on . . . As several people said . its a rip off and panders to what people might think a boutique hotel is supposed to be like .

This book does n't NOT_deliver . It spends all this time talking about things that we could grasp just by looking in the help section of the program . It goes over basic things several times and makes it sound very complicated when it is totally simple . This book is good for people who have alot of time to waste and money", "Anyone who rates this more than one star has mental deficiencies . Seriously", "Zone location beware . Ok Location really is everything . Firstly the hotel is located in suburbs and so you have to catch a bus . 990 . into the vatican city . This takes approximately 30 mins to get to piazza cavour during the quiet times and up to 45 mins during rush hour . This is quite a problem . Imagine you have an early start at 8 00 spend the whole day in town and fancy heading back to your hotel to get changed . This means anywhere from 60 - 90 minute round trip to get to your hotel and then back into town for the night . Not NOT_good . Also you need to eat and the hotel has no NOT_restaurant and there are only snack bars or takeaways nearby . SO you really need to eat in town . meaning the journey or you stay out . Another very important point if you want to see the sights is that the journey only takes you to the vatican city . not NOT_rome NOT_city . To give you an idea it takes about an hour to get to rome city and the sites . and an 80 minutes to get to the colloseum . SO this hotel is a real hassle for those wanting to see all the sites over by the colloseum . ANd believe me this is where most of teh good sites are such as colloseum . palatino . baths of caracha might be spelt wrong .   trevi fountain etc . The catacombs are also this side and require another bus journey .   or walk as we did for over an hour from the baths .   So bear in mind the catacombs are about 2 hours from the hotel . If you do nt mind this and just want the st pauls bassillica and to see the cistine chapel etc then the hotel is 30 - 45 mins from here Also with regards to the hotel . Breakfast is limited . you get rice krispies or cornflakes . You also get croissants and bread . plus if you are lucky and get there in time you get a yoghurt . They also provide a slice of cheese or slice of ham for you . I think its ltd . To cap it off because there is no NOT_restaurant NOT_there NOT_should NOT_be NOT_a NOT_kettle NOT_in NOT_the NOT_room . but there is no NOT_kettle . So no NOT_tea NOT_making NOT_facilities NOT_There NOT_is NOT_a NOT_bar NOT_that NOT_no NOT_one NOT_goes NOT_to NOT_in NOT_the NOT_lobby . ITs lifeless . Other errors at the hotel are our key card needed reprogramming every day to allow us in the room and if you do nt stick the shower curtain to the wall correctly the bathroom floods and there is no NOT_drain NOT_so NOT_it NOT_stays NOT_wet NOT_on NOT_the NOT_positive NOT_the NOT_room NOT_is NOT_clean . spacious and airy . it has a minibar and a free safe So its up to you . If you only want the vatican side its ok . But if you want the rest of the sites its not NOT_good . On the very positive side rome really does have some exceptional sites worth seeing .

Bill , too , is seen arm - in - arm with a couple of models before he 's pulled away to deal with an overdoser . Back home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice 's aggressive jealousy kicks in . As retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed . This hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black - and - white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman . It 's all way too much for him . For revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker . He almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store . Then he almost does the hooker 's roommate .

However , the book is a major disappointment , because of its many mistakes and poor organization . Most of the mistakes are ones you can work around -- for example , on page 8 the topics covered by appendixes A and B are reversed -- but the sheer number of such mistakes makes reading the book a major distraction .

He plays doctor john dolittle , who as a child had the ability to understand animals . However , after being ' exorcised ' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller , played by oliver platt . ) However , with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns , and ' comedy ' is ready and waiting to happen . Except comedy never does happen . Doctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh . Poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers . The manic murphy we saw in the 80 's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90 's . The voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the ' new ' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as ' lucky ' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie . Sadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb . And they 're not ' NOT_funny ' NOT_dumb , NOT_like NOT_dumb & NOT_dumber ( NOT_1994 ) , but just boring dumb . The film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs . There are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between . If i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him . Sadly , he 's barely NOT_in NOT_the NOT_movie , and rock 's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time . Joke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor . The director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films . She bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this . The scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done . The animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets . There 's an impressive looking tiger , however , and the lip sync is pretty good . You 'd have no NOT_problem NOT_guessing NOT_that NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_close NOT_up NOT_'s NOT_are NOT_puppets , NOT_however , NOT_with NOT_their NOT_jilted NOT_movement . I was hoping jim hensons workshop , who created the furry friends , would have done a better job . Doctor dolittle , in the end , is a disappointment for everyone involved . Murphy has done much better movies ( i. e Trading places ) the director has seen better days , and even the creatures are n't NOT_that NOT_good . The target audience , aged between 7 - 13 , who are undemanding , will probably like it however , thanks to it 's dumbed down humour . Everyone else , however , should give doctor dolittle a miss .", "Plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together . Kewl ... now I only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie ... Critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone 's talent .

And why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me . And to anybody who decided that this project was \" funny \" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci ... well , What can i say ... i Just do n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_words . So is this the worst movie that i 've seen all year ? No . but it definitely sucks and it 's basically because ... well , It 's just not NOT_funny . And for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it . It starts off slow , it 's got no NOT_energy , NOT_it NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_engage NOT_you NOT_with NOT_any NOT_of NOT_its NOT_characters ( NOT_julia NOT_barely NOT_gets NOT_somewhat NOT_interesting NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film , NOT_everyone NOT_else ... lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it 's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see - through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting ... waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing . And then hank azaria shows up ... aaaaaah , the film 's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that 's another story altogether ) . But when an experienced \" voice \" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer \" blockbuster \" romantic comedy with an over - the - top antonio banderas accent , damn dude ... your Film 's in trouble ! ! Rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself . The references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio - plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he 's going to kill himself ( hardy - har - har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball - sniffing dog that has no NOT_place NOT_being NOT_in NOT_the NOT_location NOT_at NOT_the NOT_end NOT_of NOT_the NOT_movie , NOT_well ... i Could go on .

A dud all the way around . Btw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene ( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then ... well , It basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit !

The Hotel itself looks good from the outside and the lobby . bar . breakfast room were bright and modern . Staff on the front desk were pleasant . helpful and spoke very fluent English . Unfortunately our room was a complete let down . particularly for a hotel claiming to be 4 star . Although kept very clean by the cleaning staff . the carpets were grubby .   looking dated as were soft furnishings and wall paper . We had the smallest room on the no NOT_smoking NOT_floor and even by Rome standards it was pokey and claustrophobic . In the bathroom you could not NOT_get NOT_in NOT_the NOT_shower NOT_without NOT_shuffling NOT_sideways NOT_past NOT_the NOT_toilet and similarly . sitting on the toilet meant having your knees pressed up against the shower door frame . we are not NOT_tall NOT_people .   In the room there was only space to put one suitcase and you could not NOT_open NOT_the NOT_wardrobe NOT_without NOT_the NOT_doors NOT_hitting NOT_the NOT_bed . The bed itself was our main problem . It was a double bed that was desperately in need of a new mattress . It sagged badly in the middle .   my husband and I spent an uncomfortable night clinging to the raised edges . I would guess that this room has been predominantly used as a single . We asked to be moved in the morning .   were told that we would have to pay the extra for a superior room as that was all they had . We refused and they did then find us a much bigger room . carpets .   walls still looking in need of an overhaul though .   This was better but we sacrificed a view out of the front for the fire escape at the back Breakfast was good with a wide choice of food and drinks A note of caution . We booked a taxi from the hotel to the airport at 55 euro . Despite having travelled in India . Thailand . Africa . etc this was one of the scariest taxi rides we have ever had . He was travelling at 170kph on non motorway roads . swerving between lanes of traffic and blatantly ignoring red lights . We very nearly ran into the back of a truck . I know Italian drivers tend to be rather more cavalier than UK drivers . but this was extreme We may well have been unlucky with the rooms . and I can only assume that the rave reviews are from people staying on different floors to ours . On the whole - you could do worse . but you could also do a whole lot better . We stayed in some far superior 2 .   3 star places elsewhere in Italy for a considerably lower price than the 170 euro per night that we paid here . With regards to the area - it felt perfectly safe .   I was quite happy to walk out by myself in the evening . but it is not NOT_the NOT_most NOT_inspiring NOT_of NOT_areas . It is however only a 15 minute walk to nicer areas .", "Dissapointing Hotel in Rome . For a reputable 5 . Hotel in Rome . we were very dissapointed with this hotel .

In the u. s. , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . Personally , i 'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . Young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not NOT_only NOT_wrote , NOT_produced , NOT_edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . His creation is about as stupid and contrived as you 'd expect from someone named yahoo . The movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein 's youth . Whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . In addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . Yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick -- a clown with an insatiable curiosity . Although yahoo 's performance is at first endearing , the one - dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e = mc2 . Yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . But after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . Young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . Yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . Almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . The instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the \" 1812 overture \" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . Halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . But it was n't NOT_until NOT_the NOT_very NOT_end NOT_that NOT_i NOT_finally NOT_put NOT_my NOT_finger NOT_on why : the comedy takes its roots not NOT_from NOT_whimsical NOT_film NOT_fantasies ( NOT_such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime - time sitcoms .

Partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo . A year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr . As godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world . Thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 . Now it 's 14 years after toho 's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run . In emmerich 's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation - induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms . When the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states . Meanwhile , tatopoulos 's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big - time news reporter . She 'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break . Of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor \" animal \" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey 's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place . Together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla . With the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation 's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla . He did n't . Right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history . The plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur - like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it 's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down . The script , however , is painfully bad . It 's fraught with lines so corny , they do n't even belong in b - movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , \" you idiot , \" or \" you stupid girl . \" I suppose when you 've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well . Why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ? Why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ? Why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ? Why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter - bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ? Okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit - picky , but hey , i was on a roll . Broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he 's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . Hank azaria does what he can , but do n't NOT_expect NOT_to NOT_see NOT_development NOT_of NOT_any NOT_of NOT_the NOT_promise NOT_he NOT_showed NOT_in NOT_the NOT_birdcage . Like broderick 's , azaria 's character is quite simply lacking in color . What really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . Casting must have been asleep on this one . The one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we 've seem him do in the past . Although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . Unfortunately , the same can not NOT_be NOT_said NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_incongruities . The entire feel of the movie is tongue - in - cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . This results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . Most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none NOT_are NOT_smart NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_to NOT_take NOT_seriously . Although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ? If we ca n't NOT_take NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_seriously , NOT_the NOT_threat NOT_they NOT_face NOT_is NOT_an NOT_empty NOT_one NOT_because NOT_we NOT_simply NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_care NOT_what NOT_happens NOT_to NOT_them . Godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light - hearted than it should be . Far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here 's a behemoth running through the city ! There 's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after - school g. i. Joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm 's way just in time . In a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire . None NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers . It 's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie . Consider another punch pulled . Through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one does n't NOT_just NOT_leave NOT_the NOT_door NOT_open , NOT_it NOT_opens NOT_into NOT_a NOT_hallway NOT_leading NOT_directly NOT_into NOT_a NOT_room NOT_where NOT_godzilla NOT_ii NOT_is NOT_waiting NOT_patiently . It made me want to gag . Emmerich should have done away with 90 % of the humor and in - jokes and played this one as a straight action film . With an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more . However , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add - ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just does n't NOT_work .

Realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island . Enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there . So , basically , what you have is this . Two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs ' firm intentions on eating them . A fairly good idea , however it 's let down by one slight problem . It 's crap . Over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky . Add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested . It becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , ' what 's for tea ? ' and ' should you cut the lawn later ? ' ( yes , you should ) . It 's a shame then really , that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in , which adds practically nothing NOT_to NOT_the NOT_far NOT_superior NOT_jurrasic NOT_park . With only a few creative and genuinely tense scenes and fabulous c. g. i Dinosaurs ( the t. rex 's have to be seen to be believed ) , there is nothing NOT_else NOT_to NOT_recommend NOT_the NOT_lost NOT_world . A very dissapointing sequel , indeed .", "\" flubber \" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney . It 's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it 's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless . What could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it 's a shame because it could have been a great film . Hypothetically , i mean . \" flubber , \" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , \" the absent minded professor , \" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as \" flubber , \" you know , flying rubber ? The new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent - mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several \" show - stopping \" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse . The basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded . In fact , he 's forgotten his wedding to the college 's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning . Does n't NOT_this NOT_warrant NOT_some NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_mental NOT_treatment ? NOT_Anyway , NOT_on NOT_his NOT_wedding NOT_day ( NOT_the NOT_third NOT_one ) , NOT_he NOT_invents NOT_the NOT_flubber , which not NOT_only NOT_bounces NOT_off NOT_of NOT_everything NOT_like NOT_a NOT_super NOT_ball NOT_on NOT_speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in \" the abyss . \" Philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon / villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j. barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to . Through a plot twist , hoenicker 's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he 's evil enough . A sub - plot involves philip 's attempts to win back sara , who 's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip 's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave - yet - unsuave asswhole once again ) . And in another subplot , philip 's day - timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one - and - only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him . Yuckity - yuck . What 's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is . You do n't NOT_need NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_cynical NOT_college NOT_student NOT_to NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_see NOT_right NOT_through NOT_this NOT_film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half - assedly re - mixing classics ( or non - classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up . Earlier in ' 97 , they released \" jungle 2 jungle , \" an adaptation of a really awful french film , \" un indien dans la ville , \" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not NOT_by NOT_much . Disney 's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively . In the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called \" magic . \" Such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh . I sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes . Who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ? Did n't NOT_think NOT_so . It does n't NOT_help NOT_that NOT_our NOT_protagonist NOT_is NOT_essentially NOT_unfunny NOT_or even really respectable . Philip is not NOT_a NOT_lovable NOT_absent NOT_minded NOT_professory , NOT_just NOT_a NOT_really NOT_dumb NOT_man NOT_being NOT_played NOT_by NOT_robin NOT_williams . Williams is a brilliant comic actor ... okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he 's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad . Those times , he 's not NOT_bad . But what are we supposed to think of a man who 's forgotten his wedding thrice ? Maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s ... I like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not NOT_only NOT_animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for \" hercules , \" which was good , but not NOT_great ) NOT_have NOT_been NOT_worse NOT_than NOT_lackluster , NOT_they NOT_'ve NOT_been NOT_pathetic . \" jungle 2 jungle \" is probably the worst film i saw last year . \" flubber \" 's probably second . What do they need to do ? Perhaps create something new . Get writers who can write something that 's universally entertaining . Films like \" the parent trap \" and \" mary poppins \" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they 're not NOT_only NOT_written NOT_to NOT_be NOT_magical NOT_to NOT_children , but to be fun to adults . What 's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ? And my god , could n't NOT_they NOT_have NOT_done NOT_something NOT_else NOT_with NOT_edie NOT_mcclurg ?", "In the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black . Sir anthony hopkins , playing a super - rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner . His oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake . The daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes . Hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts . Whichever one you like , dear , he says . And the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries . I liked that scene for two reasons . First , the cakes looked really cool . Second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act . Meet joe black is chock - full of odd performances , people doing things for no NOT_discernible NOT_reason NOT_at NOT_all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot . It 's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it 's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) . The difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess . I know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy . Case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie . However , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani . ( it 's not NOT_clear NOT_from NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_whether NOT_you NOT_need NOT_a NOT_law NOT_degree NOT_to NOT_become NOT_the NOT_angel NOT_of NOT_death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . ) It should n't NOT_take NOT_long NOT_for NOT_the NOT_observant NOT_moviegoer NOT_to NOT_realize NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_things NOT_are NOT_about NOT_to NOT_happen NOT_to NOT_mr . pitt . And indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without NOT_looking and suddenly gets squished . Well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous . So , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing - room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately . Anyway , the deceased lawyer 's body , no NOT_worse NOT_the NOT_wear NOT_from NOT_its NOT_massive NOT_injuries , NOT_is NOT_possessed NOT_by NOT_the NOT_angel NOT_of NOT_death and brad pitt takes over that role . The idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not NOT_to NOT_disturb NOT_others ) NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_take NOT_a NOT_holiday and experience the world . If this were n't NOT_hollywood , NOT_we NOT_might NOT_get NOT_an NOT_interesting NOT_metaphysical NOT_discussion NOT_of NOT_life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish - out - of - water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who 's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and does n't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_act NOT_in NOT_our NOT_society . It also does n't NOT_help NOT_that NOT_the NOT_character NOT_of NOT_death NOT_is NOT_written NOT_so NOT_inconsistently . He claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) . He speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois . He knows everything about some characters , nothing NOT_about NOT_others . And as played by brad pitt , he 's not NOT_especially NOT_menacing NOT_or NOT_charming NOT_or NOT_glamorous NOT_or NOT_intriguing , NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_just NOT_there . It 's as if someone told pitt , \" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . \" It 's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie . I 've used the phrase \" angel of death \" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt 's performance with this year 's best angel performance , nicolas cage 's in city of angels . Where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows . Where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant . Cage struck instant chemical sparks with co - star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani 's character is so shallow that she ca n't NOT_see NOT_beyond NOT_pitt NOT_'s NOT_good NOT_looks . The movie 's other top name is a much better actor , but that does n't NOT_save NOT_meet NOT_joe NOT_black . Sir anthony hopkins is n't NOT_given NOT_much NOT_better NOT_material NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with , NOT_unfortunately . He plays one of these good - hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood . ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins 's character more realistically evil . ) Hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world . Of course , no NOT_one NOT_can NOT_be NOT_sure NOT_of NOT_how NOT_they NOT_will NOT_act NOT_when NOT_death NOT_taps NOT_on NOT_their NOT_shoulder . But i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire . Hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation . Fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i 'm sure . I stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i 'm asking myself why . Movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i 'm going to do now . Go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap . Do n't NOT_go NOT_see NOT_meet NOT_joe NOT_black , NOT_because NOT_all NOT_it NOT_will NOT_do NOT_is NOT_move NOT_you NOT_three NOT_long NOT_hours NOT_closer NOT_to NOT_death . -- curtis edmonds \" no NOT_children NOT_have NOT_ever NOT_meddled NOT_with NOT_the NOT_republican NOT_party and lived to tell about it . \" -- sideshow bob", "let me first say this , Roots is basically Paul Simon 's Graceland , except nu - metalized . these guys went to south america , cut a couple of terrible tracks with \" natives \" ? , then filled the rest of it out with generic nu - metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure . this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank - you - god - in - heaven - it's - dead Nu - metal genre - meaningless pissed off lyrics , excessive \" guesting \" of other crappy artist , bad guitar , bad sitar ( ! ) , and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn , all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint . the biggest waste of time , money , and matter . Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using . A real bummer .", "I love plenty of Contemporary Country music ... everything from \" New Bluegrass \" ( Alison Krauss & Union Station ) to \" New Country \" like Reba McEntire , Rascal Flatts , Brad Paisley , Martina ... even a lot of Faith & Shania . But I think this CD is crap . The single star is for the only good song on the album , \" Heads Carolina , Tails California \" -- but really , 1 star for one good song out of ten is a bit too generous .   I 'm astounded at how bad the other 9 songs are ... elementary - school rhyming , uninspired melody lines , stupid lyrics , below - average accompaniment , etc . One of the most annoying things to me is her habit of overpronnouncing every word in a song ... I 'd guess someone told her at some point that she slurs her words , and she was trying to overcompensate .   The result should be titled \" Hooked on Phonics , starring JoDee Messina . \"   Listen to the preview of \" On a Wing and a Prayer \" for a good example of what I 'm talking about . I thank my lucky stars I borrowed this cotton candy from the library , rather than shelling out $ 16 for one song .   Do yourself a favor and buy \" Heads Carolina , Tails California \" online if you must have it", "Hav plenty , as we are told in the beginning and reminded during the film , is a true story . Life itself is a series of true stories , but most are not NOT_movie NOT_material . As scripted , directed , and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot , hav plenty limps along at best . Its dialog is so stilted - \" you know what they say , ' no NOT_women ; NOT_no NOT_cry . ' \" - that the actors are content to read the screenplay rather than invest much energy in trying to act it . In the story , lee plenty ( cherot ) is a 28-year - old author and teaching assistant . The movie , which happens mainly over the new year 's holiday , consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed . Since he consistently refuses , caroline gooden ( tammi katherine jones ) figures that he must be gay . Eventually he and havilland \" hav \" savage ( chenoa maxwell ) get together , proving that he was n't NOT_gay NOT_after NOT_all , NOT_just NOT_picky . Sexy women can sit on his lap and ask him to go to bed with them , but he will not even kiss them . He 's a man who knows his mind , which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite and overly cute monologues . Filled with wealthy african - americans , the story is closest in tone to love jones , which was better . Hav plenty 's story does n't NOT_go NOT_anywhere . At the end it subjects us to lee plenty 's new film , which is a movie of the movie we 've just seen , but with even worse acting . \" remember folks that , as outrageous as this all seems , this is a true story . \" Hav tells the camera , but the problem is that it 's not NOT_outrageous NOT_at NOT_all NOT_or even the least bit interesting . Hav plenty is n't NOT_so NOT_much NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_film as it is a total waste of the audience 's time . Hav plenty runs 1 : 32 . It is rated r for profanity and would be fine for most teenagers .", "Eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights . As the movie 's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails . But at the same time , he 'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds . Should you sacrifice your hard - earned cash to support murphy 's risky gamble ? Well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy . Here 's what murphy thinks : \" i think the audience is expecting a good time . They gon na get sexy . They gon na get funny . They gon na get drama . They gon na get all of that . I think it 's the best movie i 've done \" ( paramount radio network ) . Here 's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without NOT_question , NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_film NOT_of NOT_the NOT_actor NOT_'s NOT_career ( NOT_i NOT_have NOT_n't NOT_seen NOT_best NOT_defense ) . And guess who 's to blame ? ! The movie 's problem is not NOT_murphy NOT_'s NOT_direction : NOT_harlem NOT_nights NOT_is NOT_a NOT_fairly NOT_good NOT_looking NOT_film . No , NOT_the NOT_project NOT_was NOT_probably NOT_doomed even before the cameras rolled . Murphy 's awful script is the culprit . Let 's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting : ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture . Yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw . Practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word . And after 15 minutes , it gets irritating . ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast . Richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes . Each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle . ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men . Murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there . But when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it 's another matter altogether . You 're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff . For instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach . And he shoots jasmine guy in the head . This is a mean - spirited movie , folks ! Lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she does n't NOT_have NOT_any NOT_scenes NOT_with NOT_murphy . Thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer . ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date . The loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film . Murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality . Sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair . ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip - off of the sting . If you 're going to make another sting movie , you 've got to do something original . Murphy 's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula . ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering . You know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped . ( 7 ) murphy 's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life . For what ? For shooting reese 's little toe off ! Needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter . In all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie . Danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take . Aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) . Aiello 's zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice . Another bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show - stopping cameo as a cry - baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy . In fact , hall 's ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie . Unfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role . Of course , i 've already mentioned that i did n't NOT_care NOT_for NOT_murphy NOT_'s NOT_character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties . They are simply spectacular -- almost worth the price of admission .", "Boo - Wop ? haha ok , anyways I bought his through Middle - Piller distro . and it 's got a couple of o.k . songs on it .

What really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way . Instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare - this movie just uses loud noises , sudden camera shifts and short quick bursts of gore ..... yawn .... everyone 's Seen it all before and knows when to expect it .

Actually , in \" double team , \" neither 's performance is all that bad . I 've always been the one critic to defend van damme -- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars ( namely steven seagal ) never aim for ; it 's just that he 's never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994 's \" timecop . \" And rodman ... Well , he 's pretty much rodman . He 's extremely colorful , and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t , even if the role is that of an ex - cia weapons expert . It 's the story that needs some major work . Van damme plays counter - terrorist operative jack quinn , who teams up with arms dealer yaz ( rodman ) to rub out deadly gangster stavros ( mickey rourke , all beefy and weird - looking ) in an antwerp amusement park . the job is botched when stavros ' son gets killed in the gunfire , and quinn is taken off to an island known as \" the colony \" -- a think tank for soldiers \" too valuable to kill \" but \" too dangerous to set free . \" Quinn escapes and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife ( natacha lindinger ) , but stavros is out for revenge and kidnaps her . So , what 's a kickboxing mercenary to do ? Quinn looks up yaz and the two travel to rome so they can rescue the woman , kill stavros , save the world and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do . With crazy , often eye - popping camera work by peter pau and rodman 's lite brite locks , \" double team \" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure . But too much tries to happen in each frame , and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated . The numerous action scenes are loud and headache - inducing and the frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about what 's going on in the movie . And much of what 's going on is just wacky . There 's a whole segment devoted to net - surfing monks that i have yet to figure out . And the climax finds quinn going head - to - head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle , trying to avoid running over land mines and hold on to quinn 's baby boy ( who 's in a bomb equipped basket ) -- all this while stavros watches shirtless from the bleachers .

We were told that it would be reasonable to walk to one place we wanted to see but it was bad advice . It took much longer to walk there than she indicated it would .

Denise calls up is a movie for and about the electronic generation , where characters are too caught up with their work and insecurities prefer to live out their relationships and fantasies on the phone . It 's a satire - and a sometimes funny one - about how we let handphones , call - waiting and answering machines run our lives . The problem : denise calls up is a movie about an idea . A darn good one , but still an 80 minute - long idea . And despite salwen 's attempt at plots and sub - plots , despite some genuinely funny moments , you can predict the movie 's outcome within the first fifteen minutes .

As martin progresses from slamming the phone on her to long phone conversations over the baby 's name , his friends - and his friends ' friends - get involved , courtesy of call - waiting and double - lines . In the tigher and more tantalizing sub - plot , barbara and jerry are set up on a blind date that neither turns up for . Both profess to have too complicated schedules to ever meet , but they get it going over the phone . With repeated phone sex comes a glitch ; what if the other person is simply faking it ? Denise calls up scores with some inspired moments . Mousy barbara metamorphoses into a vamp over her cordless , everyone shares the excitement of denise 's delivery through a conference call to her handphone , and barbara 's best friend gale is killed in a car accident while taling animatedly into another friend 's answering machine . ( as gale 's overly - chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . ) But these moments are not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_sustain NOT_the NOT_movie .

It 's full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined . I felt the same way watching drowning mona . Skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy . There are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing . There is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n. y. , being a test town for the then new yugo . Everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates . Even the police chief drives one . There is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets . There also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred . It pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends . It turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend . There are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona 's tombstone , which reads \" demoted \" , instead of devoted . Still , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond . The lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) . Each scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more . There 's no NOT_uniqueness NOT_or NOT_modulation NOT_to NOT_her NOT_or NOT_explanation NOT_for NOT_her NOT_meanness . Anyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is . The other characters are walking cardboard cutouts . Each one is defined by one trait and no NOT_further NOT_attempt NOT_is NOT_made NOT_at NOT_deeper NOT_characterization . There is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag .

I had to carry the luggage and the two year old upstairs to find the hotel . There is no NOT_lobby . just a desk with a quiet guy sitting and typing on the computer . We had one of the bigger rooms and the room was fine for the three of us . When we left rome the receptionist arranged for a private car to take us for the airport . It cost less than a taxi and the driver helped me with my luggage .", "Another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species .

They will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail . It becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of . Frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know . Often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject . Film is a different medium . It is a visual medium . That slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize . I frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space . The magazine article and the film script are two very different media . The insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article \" the man who knew too much \" by marie brenner . It is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film . It really verges on being tedious at least at times . For years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side - effects . But they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not NOT_really NOT_believe NOT_it . The business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco . The tide turned when a former vice - president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking . The resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs . Who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ? That is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . This all could have been enthralling , but it is not NOT_the NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_thing NOT_that NOT_a NOT_stylist NOT_like NOT_michael NOT_mann NOT_would NOT_be NOT_likely NOT_to NOT_do NOT_well . And in the end , he failed . To make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . The film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . We get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . They go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . There the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . This seems to have nothing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_main NOT_line NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . Terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . Incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . We discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . He had been a very profitably rewarded vice - president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . Rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . Meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not NOT_understand . They offer wigand $ 12 , 000 just to interpret the data . Wigand 's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . He is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . In spite of the secrecy , wigand 's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . And so the game begins . Wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . Meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . The film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . Wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . He and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . Al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . The story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . The film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . The musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . It puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . Also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . Plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well - known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . This film might have been a really engaging experience under another director 's control . Michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . I rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .", "\" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , \" Screams the television ads for \" hanging up , \" disastrously written by real - life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton .

And we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? Excuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . Eve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre - teen son ( jesse james ) . Her elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer 's ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . While eve 's relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up 's and down 's with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . Her older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self - titled magazine , \" georgia , \" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . Interestingly , their professions are given , but we not NOT_once NOT_ever NOT_see NOT_them NOT_working NOT_at NOT_their NOT_jobs , NOT_or , NOT_for NOT_that NOT_matter , NOT_learn NOT_much NOT_of NOT_anything NOT_about NOT_them . Maddy , georgia , and eve do not NOT_see NOT_each NOT_other NOT_much NOT_anymore , NOT_their NOT_adult NOT_lives NOT_gradually NOT_causing NOT_them NOT_to NOT_drift NOT_apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . And they talk . And talk . And talk ... In fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . If you are able to get through the opening half - hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . The question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self - involved pat - on - the - back ? How could a comedy - drama that has the star - power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? Issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film is n't NOT_mature NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_deal NOT_with NOT_such NOT_a NOT_thing NOT_in NOT_a NOT_thoughtful NOT_manner , and since we learn next to nothing NOT_about NOT_their NOT_childhood , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_lost NOT_cause NOT_that NOT_comes NOT_off as nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_an NOT_afterthought . Also , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no NOT_dynamic NOT_metamorphosizes . And when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three - minute scene in which they argue like little children . You can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . You think to yourself : \" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food - fight , \" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . Meg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no NOT_further NOT_than NOT_1998 NOT_'s \" NOT_hurlyburly \" NOT_or NOT_1994 NOT_'s \" NOT_when NOT_a NOT_man NOT_loves NOT_a NOT_woman \" ) , NOT_despite NOT_her NOT_various NOT_detractors NOT_who NOT_stubbornly NOT_believe NOT_all NOT_she NOT_can NOT_do NOT_is NOT_romantic NOT_comedies . With \" hanging up , \" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer / director / hack who should n't NOT_be NOT_allowed NOT_to NOT_work NOT_in NOT_hollywood NOT_again NOT_after NOT_this NOT_big - NOT_budget , NOT_high - NOT_profile NOT_debacle . Even if she knew what she was making was not NOT_exactly NOT_up NOT_to NOT_par NOT_in NOT_the NOT_quality NOT_department , NOT_she NOT_nonetheless NOT_is NOT_very NOT_good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run - in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son 's birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . Diane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . What is more than a little far - fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no NOT_more NOT_than NOT_five NOT_years NOT_ryan NOT_'s NOT_senior . Yeah , right . Lastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big - screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999 's \" analyze this . \" Kudrow is n't NOT_given NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_to NOT_create NOT_a NOT_full NOT_personality NOT_with NOT_maddy , NOT_so NOT_it NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_her NOT_fault NOT_she NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_register NOT_until NOT_a NOT_few NOT_quiet NOT_moments NOT_sprinkled NOT_throughout NOT_where NOT_she NOT_is NOT_actually NOT_blessed NOT_with NOT_being NOT_given NOT_dialogue . If anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar - caliber work in 1998 's \" the opposite of sex . \" If you are a fan of kudrow 's ( and who is n't ? ) , NOT_do NOT_yourself NOT_a NOT_favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than \" hanging up \" does in its entirety . As eve 's hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing NOT_to NOT_do , NOT_until NOT_a NOT_subplot NOT_reveals NOT_itself NOT_midway NOT_through , NOT_only NOT_to NOT_never NOT_be NOT_mentioned NOT_again . Cloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy - cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . Nearly all the emotions displayed within \" hanging up \" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ? If , for some bizarre , \" twilight zone \" -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over .

That is the character of denise ( lauren ambrose ) , the film 's sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film , and at one point sits down on a couch and looks totally bored . The film wisely holds over this moment , nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party ... almost Too nicely . For some members of the audience ( read : me ) , this is basically a mirror of what 's going on with them watching this film . We sit there wondering why we 've even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place . I would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this . After all , this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high school with . Everyone 's here : the jock , the homecoming queen , the nerd ( and his dominions of trekkies and x - philes ) , the alienated wannabe writer , the school spirit girl , the pothead ( s ) , the wigger , etc , etc , etc , and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial , lame , and basically as a bunch of losers . Except for denise , who rolls her eyes at everything , and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks ( her yearbook entry , something which is done for each main character , quotes oscar wilde - definite pointers there ) . Unfortunately , the writers and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film . The film , as i said , portrays most of its characters as superficial and just totally ignorant to everything . However , instead of sticking with this , perhaps even going a bit further with it , they let this lie , and actually make these characters into our heroes . We follow several of them , all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread of humanity and realism , and tries to tell boring and overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared and/or identified with them . And if we did , we certainly do n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_revisit NOT_that NOT_state NOT_of NOT_being . Here 's a quick low - down : it 's graduation , and we follow a bunch of seniors on the last night , otherwise known as the \" american grafitti \" or , to a lesser extent , the \" dazed and confused \" cliche . The formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly ; the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party . \" ca n't NOT_hardly NOT_wait \" NOT_just NOT_opts NOT_for NOT_a NOT_big NOT_indoor NOT_keg NOT_party , and a little bit of aimless driving , albeit of the i'm - whining - because - i - can't - get - a - girl - i - want brand . We follow many people around , but mostly we trail preston ( ethan embry , of \" that thing you do ! \" ) , the alienated writer , who 's been pining over the homcoming queen , amanda ( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt ) , for the entirety of high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart . Now that she 's broken up with her football player boyfriend , mike ( peter facinelli ) , he decides to go to the party with a note he 's written declaring his \" love \" for her in the hopes he 'll build up the guts to give it to her ... even Though he 's leaving for a multi - week intensive writing program hosted by none NOT_other NOT_than NOT_kurt NOT_vonnegut ( NOT_okay : NOT_the NOT_ingenius NOT_vonnegut NOT_or NOT_some NOT_icky NOT_noxema NOT_spokesperson ? ) . Since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what goes on with it would n't NOT_be NOT_able NOT_to NOT_carry NOT_a NOT_commercial NOT_let NOT_alone NOT_a NOT_feature NOT_film , and because it 's a party , there are some more main characters , such as : william ( charlie korsmo , finally surfacing after \" dick tracy \" ) , the nerd ( and his dominions ) who has come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike , who 's humiliated him for years , but gets too caught up in drinking to do it ; kenny ( seth green ) , the wigger , who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid ( uh huh ) ; and denise , the only exceptional character , who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom ( do n't NOT_ask ) NOT_with NOT_kenny NOT_where NOT_the NOT_two NOT_characters NOT_let NOT_down NOT_their NOT_characters and are allowed to follow the laws of plot cliches from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile . Ugh . The main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not \" NOT_american NOT_grafitti \" NOT_or \" NOT_dazed and confused , \" two films that embraced and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers ( not NOT_to NOT_mention NOT_were NOT_extremely NOT_entertaining ) , but to john hughes films of the 80s , most notably \" sixteen candles . \" The big difference in the two is that that film managed to not NOT_only NOT_embrace but even satirize its main characters , and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion . This film forgets to satirize its characters , and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes ... and Then says that it 's all okay . We ca n't NOT_take NOT_this NOT_film NOT_seriously , NOT_nor NOT_can NOT_we NOT_take NOT_this as fun , so really what good is it ? But i will tell you some things i did like : i liked the direction , except for a couple too - over - the - top features , like way - too - glossy jump cuts ( it 's like an oxymoron ) and other obscurities . Generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman - esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) . I actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in \" radio days \" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable ... almost . And , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film . However , the character of denise really does n't NOT_work NOT_with NOT_the NOT_film , NOT_when NOT_really NOT_thought NOT_about . She 's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone . She 's not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_cynic NOT_or NOT_the NOT_intellectual ; NOT_she NOT_'s NOT_just NOT_a NOT_very NOT_interesting NOT_character NOT_who NOT_provides NOT_entertainment even if it further damages other already damaged characters . She may ruin the film more , but at least when she 's on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves \" well , at least we 'll be entertained . \" A couple other things that just do n't NOT_work : NOT_mike NOT_'s NOT_character , NOT_who NOT_suffers NOT_an NOT_epiphany NOT_throughout NOT_the NOT_film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just does n't NOT_work NOT_at NOT_all : NOT_jenna NOT_eflman NOT_'s NOT_uncredited NOT_cameo as an angel - just did n't NOT_work , but nice try . Basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i 'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we 'd do . We do n't NOT_feel NOT_for NOT_these NOT_characters NOT_because NOT_for NOT_most NOT_of NOT_us , NOT_we NOT_are NOT_n't NOT_stereotypes NOT_going NOT_through NOT_the NOT_motions NOT_to NOT_worn NOT_subplots .

Rated r. Summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee 's abilities . Lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . But here , he gets himself into a bind . His latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . The summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . It was the hottest summer on record . To boot , new york 's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . So it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . The movie 's focus is on a group of twenty - somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club - hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . We follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . Vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . Ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \" eccentric , \" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . Tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam 's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . A local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . At the top of the list is ritchie . Vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . As we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \" so what ? \" Question springs to mind . From the way this movie is made , i 'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . Lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70 's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters ' very personal dilemmas -- but he does n't NOT_bring NOT_all NOT_of NOT_his NOT_topics NOT_together NOT_to NOT_form NOT_a NOT_coherent NOT_theme NOT_or NOT_make NOT_a NOT_discernible NOT_statement . All is not NOT_lost NOT_if NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_turns NOT_out NOT_to NOT_be NOT_hollow ; NOT_it NOT_can NOT_be NOT_a NOT_saving NOT_grace NOT_for NOT_the NOT_film NOT_to NOT_be NOT_enjoyable . Too bad summer of sam does n't NOT_get NOT_any NOT_help NOT_here . Frankly , it 's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that does n't NOT_entertain NOT_beyond NOT_its NOT_first NOT_half NOT_hour . There is no NOT_suspense NOT_because NOT_the NOT_film NOT_refuses NOT_to NOT_be NOT_fully NOT_about NOT_the NOT_murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . Leguizamo 's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . The script makes it clear that we 're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . You 'd never guess from his performance . Adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . Sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i 'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true - to - heart . Brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . Summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it 's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . But it 's also empty , pretentious and boring . Like last year 's the thin red line , it 's a movie by a director who does n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_he NOT_wants NOT_to NOT_say but goes ahead and says it anyway . ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;", "ALL OF THE SONGS ARE BORING .

Kevin pollack is the stereotypical female - fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which were n't NOT_very NOT_funny . Couteney cox is the stereotypical career - minded woman who falls in love . Julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman . ( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical .

But when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . With a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . It got my vote for ' the movie where i expected the least and got the most ' . And , if you have n't NOT_had NOT_the NOT_opportunity , NOT_i NOT_would NOT_definitely NOT_recommend NOT_that NOT_you NOT_see NOT_it NOT_on NOT_video . In the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth 's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . The mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld 's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth 's safety for another generation . Mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . Despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . Outworld 's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four - armed ogre ) , and sindel . Earth 's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld 's forces . It 's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . It is only a video game , after all , but the on - screen version tries to go beyond it 's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self - worth , and worst of all , a love story . This becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing NOT_more . They are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . This becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . The original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . They spoke little , but fought a lot . Thus , the movie was easy to digest . However , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . This uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . Not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_he NOT_talk NOT_in NOT_riddles and offer enigmatic ( e. g. Useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . Try reading this half as fast , and you 'll hear what i mean . But the movie is not NOT_a NOT_complete NOT_fatality . Fight scenes are well - choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . And players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_cameo . Even if you 're not NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_the NOT_video NOT_game , NOT_each NOT_fighter NOT_has NOT_their NOT_own NOT_costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . But it 's just too little of what movie - goers and especially fans of the game will expect . Oddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . And the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) .

With director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top - notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . Those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : NOT_a NOT_solid , NOT_well - NOT_written NOT_screenplay . Call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer do n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_mix NOT_well . Gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . His cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name does n't NOT_provide NOT_any NOT_insight NOT_or NOT_analogy NOT_to NOT_the NOT_shakespearean NOT_character . Jack has become addicted to \" feeding the hole \" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . When he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . Gary oldman 's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . In the process , he also gets tangled - up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . Demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no NOT_problems NOT_maneuvering NOT_within NOT_the NOT_mob NOT_world .

What a woman ! Lena olin 's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . Anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo 's wife . There is little insight into her character . She 's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . Juliette lewis , as romeo 's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis ' portrayal certainly did n't NOT_improve NOT_it . Both women were anything but sexy or attractive . Poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . It is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) NOT_to NOT_do NOT_something .

We need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . This picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1/10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . The only thing saving it from a 0/10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . So , it does indeed have some plusses ... In fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . And her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone .

He wrote the ( ha ha ! ) Script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . The same team who created a good sex - film in 1992 ( \" basic instinct \" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x - rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . The predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . After the supposed street - smart young \" lady \" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack - jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the \" stardust hotel \" .

Crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . He also happens to be the pleasure - seeking worm who runs the big show . Crystal gets nomi onto the \" stardust \" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi \" earns \" the role of crystal 's understudy . The slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . It was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she 's \" not NOT_a NOT_whore \" . That 's a phrase we hear a few different times and it 's completely ludicrous . Of course she is ! She sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we 're supposed to believe that she 's a better person than that . We 're supposed to root for her . No NOT_way ! NOT_She NOT_'s NOT_a NOT_tramp and a back - stabber who deserved nothing -- NOT_least NOT_of NOT_all NOT_vindication NOT_in NOT_the ... ahem ... climax . She is not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is .

His sleazy character is important to \" showgirls \" , but we do n't NOT_learn NOT_anything NOT_about NOT_him .

What few reviewers take issue with is how mean - spirited this movie is . Everyone 's either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge .

I found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it 's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it 's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . As a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries .

He 's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he does n't NOT_snipe NOT_or NOT_make NOT_clean NOT_kills -- NOT_he NOT_just NOT_kicks NOT_the NOT_door NOT_down and shoots everything ) . He works with a few other hitmen -- cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . They 're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . They all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . It is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . They decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . When they do this , it turns out she is paris ' . . . Goddaughter ! It 's very bad to have paris against you . The story is standard action film stuff . It 's nothing NOT_new , and nothing NOT_particularly NOT_offensive ( but certainly not NOT_the NOT_slightest NOT_bit NOT_compelling ) . Clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it 's a john woo - type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . It 's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face / off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . There are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_story . They use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . Melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . Like i said , it 's not NOT_boring ; NOT_most NOT_disasters NOT_are NOT_n't . What makes it so bad is its genre - shifting madness . It seems to start out as a quirky - but - realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . Then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . Then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . Keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . And scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not NOT_be NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_at NOT_all . One of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . The scene is played for laughs , but it is n't NOT_funny . And since it does n't NOT_quite NOT_work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . This is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . Cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . Characters betray each other without NOT_a NOT_second NOT_thought . Grenades are thrown in tight places . People jump out of tall buildings and survive . People outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . Most frustrating of all , though , is the film 's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . They 're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand - held machineguns ) . The characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously does n't NOT_make NOT_for NOT_deep NOT_or NOT_interesting NOT_people NOT_to NOT_watch . The acting is kind of fun , though -- wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . Phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin 's fianc ? e , is convincingly air - headed . The big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . The funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not NOT_by NOT_the NOT_numerous NOT_failed NOT_attempts NOT_at NOT_sight NOT_gags and one - liners . It 's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . Despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . You can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . If you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .", "A lame group of angry teenagers screaming about themselves .

If only I could give 0 stars ..", "Capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . Christopher lambert vs. evil ninjas in modern - day japan ... And nobody wins . The hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain - damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . I could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it were n't NOT_also NOT_insanely NOT_xenophobic and insulting . Christopher lambert plays a computer - parts salesman who 's on business in japan . He meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . Apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . Since lambert is a witness , he 's of course the next one to die . Let 's stop and think about this for a second . If lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he 'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . In this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . I imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . You know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no NOT_matter NOT_what NOT_their NOT_real NOT_dexterity NOT_is . This is , of course , only the beginning of the movie 's problems . Lambert eventually finds pseudo - safety with a long - haired modern - day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . They are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . The script does n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_the NOT_hell NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_them . Lone , as the bad guy , is zero - dimensional . The only bad - guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . In the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . What 's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not NOT_sterotypes -- NOT_there NOT_'s NOT_a NOT_nice NOT_little NOT_scene NOT_with NOT_a NOT_tokyo NOT_cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . Also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it 's been designed to accompany . There is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re - couple the whole thing with the movie 's relentlessly stupid plot . By the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham - handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no NOT_longer NOT_care .

To be fair , some jokes ARE funny and some stories ARE enjoyable and amusing . He is anti - PC which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like Rosie O'Donnell , Michael Moore , Barney Frank , Barbara Streisand , and \" that fat girl from the Dixie Chicks \" , among others .   No NOT_problem NOT_there NOT_in NOT_my NOT_opinion . That is the entirety of the positive things I can say about the book . The rest is just babble , often repeated over and over again , that even Larry lovers will find annoying .   A couple things that really bothered me .   The first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of \" retards \" and Down 's Syndrome children .   He must use the term \" retard \" at least fifty+ times in the book .   This is appreciably different than making a joke about , say , Michael Moore .   Moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes .   The Down 's Syndrome children did not . My opinion of Larry The Cable Guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on \" retards \" .   He also racially sterotypes in the book .   Many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond .   The Down 's Syndrome kids ca n't .   Larry , I can only hope God ( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book ) grants you a \" retard \" child to love and care for .   Then , I would like to read your next book . I suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly . The second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that Larry is a fraud in many senses .   He plays the good ' ol Bubba . He ai n't NOT_too NOT_bright and he ai n't NOT_ever NOT_changed NOT_since NOT_he NOT_left NOT_the NOT_farm .   His \" celebrity \" - his word not NOT_mine - NOT_has NOT_not NOT_gone NOT_to NOT_his NOT_head . OK , Larry . Why then the better than thou tone throughout the book - including speeches and lectures , including serious topics such as abortion ?   Why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down ?   Why the unrelenting references to your \" celebrity \" ?   The terms \" meet and greet \" and \" after - party \" were used over and over and over , as an example .   Do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are ?   Well , you are wrong .   They are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become .   That 's Hollywood - speak my country , fart loving , nose picking friend . Overall , this book is a true disappointment and Larry The Cable Guy is a true moron ( see does n't NOT_that NOT_sound NOT_better NOT_than \" NOT_retard \" ) .   My Father always taught me there are two types of dumb people .   Those who are dumb and know they are dumb .   And those who are dumb but are so dumb , they do n't NOT_realize NOT_it .   The former category usually shuts up ( knowing they are dumb ) .   The latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter . The first group is obviously smarter than the second . Larry The Cable Guy falls smack dab in the last group .   The fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book . Make jokes , Larry , and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like . Unfortunately , Larry ca n't NOT_see NOT_the NOT_obvious .   Like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book , he has become exactly one of them .   A thin layer of \" Good ' Ol Boy \" on top , covering a core of venom and \" celebrity \" . He plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets .

Us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements Copyright 1999 nathaniel r. atcheson A fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not NOT_speak NOT_of NOT_himself NOT_in NOT_his NOT_own NOT_review . I 've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case . The fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them . The original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people . For me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well ) . I am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that does n't NOT_make NOT_me NOT_any NOT_less NOT_dedicated NOT_to NOT_it . On the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies . When i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine - film series , i got exited . When i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year - long drool of anticipation . And when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film . But then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm 's secretive snobbery over the picture . In the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it . I was tired of seeing cardboard cut - outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell . I just wanted to see the movie . Reader , do not NOT_misunderstand . I did not NOT_have NOT_an NOT_anti - NOT_hype NOT_reaction . The hype was unavoidable . I understand and accept the hype -- it 's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released . Five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem . \" who are these jedi knights ? \" I asked . \" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine - gun rapidity ? \" \" why are n't NOT_these NOT_characters NOT_being NOT_developed NOT_before NOT_their NOT_adventures ? \" \" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? \" These were just some of my questions early on . Later , i asked , \" where 's the magic of the first three films ? \" And \" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? ' By the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed . George lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster . The phantom menace is no NOT_star NOT_wars NOT_film . Take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you 're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time . It 's an embarrassment . I looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot is n't NOT_used . There are a few of each , but they 're all token attempts . The fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects . This is not NOT_what NOT_i NOT_wanted NOT_to NOT_see . I did n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_leave NOT_the NOT_phantom NOT_menace NOT_with NOT_a NOT_headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did . The story centers mostly around qui - gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi - wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo . Naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people . After picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) . Qui - gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys . The bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters . There is n't NOT_anything NOT_particularly NOT_wrong NOT_with NOT_this NOT_story NOT_when NOT_looking NOT_at NOT_it NOT_in NOT_synopsis NOT_form . The way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory . First of all , we do n't NOT_learn NOT_one NOT_single NOT_thing NOT_about NOT_qui - NOT_gon NOT_jinn . Not NOT_one NOT_thing . What was his life like before this film ? Well , i imagine he did n't NOT_have NOT_one . That 's why he feels like a plot device . This probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he 's recently retired from film ( i do n't NOT_blame NOT_him , NOT_honestly ) . Obi - wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . Mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . Since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . Things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed - out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . I was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . And when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . Also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no NOT_depth NOT_has NOT_been NOT_written . Jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i 've ever had to endure , but he 's more interesting than most of the humans . As soon as the relatively - brief segment on tatooine is over , it 's back to the mind - numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . I 've seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i 've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . The reason is obvious : george lucas has no NOT_restraint . I ca n't NOT_say NOT_that NOT_i NOT_did NOT_n't NOT_find NOT_the NOT_effects NOT_original , NOT_because NOT_i NOT_did -- NOT_the NOT_final NOT_battle NOT_between NOT_darth NOT_maul , NOT_obi - NOT_wan , and qui - gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . But i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . My breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . Ca n't NOT_we NOT_have NOT_one NOT_stinking NOT_scene NOT_that NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_bursting NOT_at NOT_the NOT_seems NOT_with NOT_a NOT_special NOT_effects NOT_shot ? NOT_I NOT_got NOT_so NOT_sick NOT_of NOT_looking NOT_at NOT_the NOT_cgi NOT_characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . And then there 's the question of magic . What was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? I have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . John williams ' familiar score is no NOT_help , NOT_nor NOT_is NOT_lucas ' NOT_direction . I think it comes right down to characters : there are none NOT_here . I longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no NOT_such NOT_thing . And what about the ridiculous expectations ? Mine were n't NOT_that NOT_high ; NOT_i NOT_simply NOT_wanted NOT_a NOT_film NOT_that NOT_showed NOT_me NOT_the NOT_roots NOT_of NOT_the NOT_films NOT_that NOT_i NOT_grew NOT_up NOT_loving , NOT_a NOT_story NOT_that NOT_had NOT_a NOT_few NOT_characters and a few great special effects . Instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . I do n't NOT_hate NOT_the NOT_phantom NOT_menace as much as i resent it : i 'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i ca n't . It 's here to stay . I can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they do n't , NOT_then NOT_lucas NOT_will NOT_have NOT_pulled NOT_off NOT_the NOT_impossible NOT_task NOT_of NOT_destroying NOT_his NOT_own NOT_indestructible NOT_series .", "Very Average Hotel .

His data sources are vast and highly informative .   The major limitation of this   publication is that the central argument is biased . Lardy selects those   data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view . As a   result , major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in   transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over .   Lardy 's view is   the typical Western , dare I say & quot;American&quot ; argument . Primarily he   uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of China 's   state banks . This methodoloy is extremely poor - particularly in the   context of China 's trannsitional economy . Financial criteria are a horrible   guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency . If anyone would   like elaboration on this point feel free to email me .   In summary , Lardy 's   book is informative and makes for interesting reading . However as a piece   of economic analysis , its usefulness is limited . The major reason for this   is a total lack of economic theory(as indicated by the previous reviewer )   which has resulted in a poor methodology", "No , NOT_not NOT_really .

After losing a sanctioned battle with _ dragon _ 's jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice - cube tray ( well , that 's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet . If you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you 're way ahead of the game . The renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half - expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute . It 's surprising that _ soldier _ is the brain - child of _ blade runner _ co - writer david webb peoples . Unlike that mind - twisting classic , this film contains just barely NOT_enough NOT_dialogue NOT_to NOT_fill NOT_about NOT_three NOT_double - NOT_spaced NOT_pages . Add into the mix the _ mortal kombat _ 's paul anderson inept direction , and it 's easy to see how _ soldier _ turned out so bad . And the special effects ! Remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ? Gary busey is in this movie . 'nuff said . _ soldier _ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults . That this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all . Now if you 'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future .", "Michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction . The most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel . So in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big - budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel . Congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not NOT_going NOT_to NOT_fare NOT_a NOT_whole NOT_lot NOT_better . It a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good . The film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l. jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting . Several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered . The plan he wrote was only semi - serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien . Now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s . Suddenly norman 's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft . Included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l. jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) . Together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets . One major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold - toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship . What is disappointing about this film is that it does not NOT_have NOT_really NOT_effective NOT_performances . Director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects . The problem here is he is making a big - budget science fiction film . It has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen . The technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer 's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting . That could be a reasonable approach in a low - budget film . But that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster . It requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they do n't . Hoffman 's acting seems muted . Jackson seems to laid back . We do not NOT_feel NOT_for NOT_these NOT_characters and do not NOT_get NOT_inside NOT_their NOT_heads . Levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not NOT_really NOT_get NOT_price NOT_performance . And why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody 's guess . a Cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price . Look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors . Most science fiction spectaculars these days have second - tier actors and first - tier special effects . Levinson tries second - tier effects , and first - tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer . Perhaps sci - fi spectaculars are just not NOT_an NOT_actor NOT_'s NOT_medium . The result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .", "Beware of the . apartments .   While the hotel itself seems lovely . we were booked by the reservation staff to stay in their . big . beautiful apartments . across from the hotel . The website calls them . silent and elegant .   They were terrible My parents were in an apartment across from a restaurant with windows on the square .

So here goes : the juvenile , college - set black comedy _ dead_man_on_campus _ is dead on arrival . Strait - laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish - free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever - partying roommate , cooper ( mark - paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze - filled nights that come with university life . With the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good - hearted slackers to do ? Easy -- look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student 's ( or students ' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . So instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . Director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper 's diabolical plot . Until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _ saved_by_the_bell _ alumnus gosselaar 's sitcom - bred mugging . That said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . The introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . One wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . Not NOT_surprisingly , NOT_he NOT_does NOT_resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . The same can be said about all of _ dead_man_on_campus _ . Whatever morbid appeal the far - fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self - absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get - go . _ dead_man _ does n't NOT_grow NOT_tiresome ; NOT_it NOT_already _ NOT_is _ NOT_once NOT_the NOT_clever NOT_opening NOT_titles NOT_are NOT_through . As it slogs along to a cheesy , happy - for - all - parties conclusion , _ dead_man _ lives up to its title and then some -- not NOT_only NOT_does NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on ...

That fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing \" the way of the gun \" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna - be 's but upon closer inspection does n't NOT_look NOT_like NOT_anything NOT_comprehendable . It 's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that wo n't NOT_allow NOT_the NOT_story NOT_much NOT_room NOT_to NOT_expand NOT_outside NOT_its NOT_handful NOT_of NOT_characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous . Complexity should come as no NOT_surprise NOT_to NOT_anyone NOT_who NOT_'s NOT_familiar NOT_with NOT_mcquarrie , NOT_he NOT_wrote \" NOT_the NOT_usual NOT_suspects , \" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim . That film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings . You have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that \" if it 's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . \" With \" the way of the gun \" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped . The film tells the story of two drifters with no NOT_ambition and barely NOT_a NOT_reason NOT_to NOT_live but are n't NOT_hell - NOT_bent NOT_on NOT_death NOT_either ( NOT_played NOT_by NOT_ryan NOT_phillipie and benecio del toro ) . They get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big - shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization . They figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom . Along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the \" bag man \" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he 's doing ) . The exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously ca n't NOT_call NOT_the NOT_authorities NOT_for NOT_help . His goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers ' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back . The exec 's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right . Meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double - crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no NOT_surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all . Mcquarrie does n't NOT_know NOT_the NOT_meaning NOT_of NOT_the NOT_word NOT_simple . He seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie . Everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it 's to the point of surrealism . Nothing NOT_is NOT_what NOT_it NOT_seems NOT_in NOT_this NOT_reality , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_one NOT_of NOT_those NOT_movies NOT_where NOT_you NOT_get NOT_dropped NOT_right NOT_into NOT_the NOT_middle NOT_of NOT_the NOT_criminal NOT_world and are expected to know most of the industry 's rules and regulations . Every scene with caan 's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about \" the business \" and how it works and we 're hardly NOT_given NOT_a NOT_clue as to what they 're talking about . These characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they 're more like ideas ripped - off from sketches found in david mamet 's trash . No NOT_one NOT_here NOT_really NOT_acts NOT_like NOT_a NOT_real NOT_person , and the story is even further removed from reality . It 's like a dream without NOT_any NOT_appeal . Take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff . They sit on a brand - new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they do n't NOT_move . The guy and his loud - mouth , potty - mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them . You 'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they do n't , NOT_instead NOT_phillipe NOT_throws NOT_one NOT_punch and the two get beat down by a mob .

Secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed . Lastly , it serves no NOT_purpose NOT_in NOT_the NOT_long NOT_run NOT_because NOT_later NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_the NOT_two NOT_are NOT_packing NOT_more NOT_artillery NOT_than NOT_a NOT_small NOT_country NOT_'s NOT_army . If they were suicidal they would n't NOT_have NOT_gone NOT_on NOT_the NOT_kidnapping NOT_job NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) . There 's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility . What it all comes down to is that nothing NOT_here NOT_is NOT_what NOT_it NOT_seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is . Absolutely none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_are NOT_likable NOT_or NOT_believable . And it 's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not NOT_a NOT_flat - NOT_out NOT_black NOT_comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time . With any film you see , whether you like it or not , NOT_you NOT_can NOT_at NOT_least NOT_understand NOT_what NOT_the NOT_appeal NOT_was NOT_to NOT_it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it .

But unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . The iffiness in judge 's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not NOT_in NOT_its NOT_appeal . In fact , based on the popularity of scott adams ' cartoon \" dilbert , \" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . Unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit - length sequences which would be more at home on the set of \" saturday night live \" rather than a full - length feature . The most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie 's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . Other evidence of office space 's failure to work are its lack of good jokes . The comedy is marginally funny at best , but not NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_get NOT_a NOT_packed NOT_house NOT_of NOT_theater - NOT_goers NOT_to NOT_laugh NOT_out NOT_loud . The material in the movie is on - key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . However , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . The plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . After the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c. mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of \" downsizing \" the company 's payroll . When peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . The circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but .

It achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help . The whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed .

Well , there was no NOT_real NOT_acting NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie but some of the slapstick was n't NOT_the NOT_easiest NOT_i NOT_am NOT_sure .

I think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie . Now the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting . I think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie . A different actor might have done a better job of it but i wo nt presume that was n't NOT_what NOT_was NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_be NOT_achieved . One thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results . Tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers . I can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek . Bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved . Now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly . The form of humor in this movie will not NOT_be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless . But if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie . But to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not NOT_go NOT_to NOT_see NOT_this NOT_movie .

Erected in 1871 , deserted and decomposing since 1985 , the danvers mental hospital , is one of the most malevolent \" locations \" ever chosen for a film . The structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble - strewn corridors , collapsing floors , stagnant pools of water , isolation cells , and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre - frontal lobotomies were performed - that their task seems impossible within that time frame . And each member of their inexperienced crew ( stephan gevedon , brandon sexton iii , and josh lucas ) is coping with his own personal demons as , one by one , their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they 're working . The film 's title is derived from salvaged reel - to - reel audio - recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities . By the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters . Filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw - massacre - type ghost story but the script lacks structure and is n't NOT_particularly NOT_scary . The conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing . On the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" session 9 \" is a dark , gloomy 4 . silly me ... at First , i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs . danvers , the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock 's truly terrifying \" rebecca \" that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley .", "Susan granger 's review of \" mulholland drive \" ( universal focus ) Whatever david lynch is selling , i 'm not NOT_buying . From the writer / director of \" blue velvet \" and \" twin peaks \" comes another dark , mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive , the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills . Dazed , a beautiful brunette ( laura elena harring ) emerges and stumbles down a hill , slipping unobserved into a ' 30s - style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip . The next morning , a dewy blonde ( naomi watts ) from deep river , ontario , arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase . Her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet . The brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust . Meanwhile , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there 's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roaming the city . The tortuous paths of these various characters - and others named cookie , coco and cowboy - intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because , midway through the story , lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality , leaving a huge wad of cash , a blue metallic key , a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered .

Mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined . And though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale . Art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent . You know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist . Enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant . He can merely gaze at a super - encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says . Naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government . Lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest \" unbreakable \" code , mercury . However , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury - encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code . Naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator - like hitman ( l. l. Ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard . And that 's where art jeffries comes in . For some reason that 's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy . In a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall . The central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous . Why bother trying to kill the kid ... i Mean , who would know ? It 's not NOT_like NOT_the NOT_kid ( NOT_or NOT_anyone NOT_else NOT_for NOT_that NOT_matter ) NOT_knew NOT_he NOT_was NOT_cracking NOT_a NOT_government NOT_super - NOT_cypher .

There 's always the chance that someone else would crack it ... but I guess without NOT_a NOT_kid NOT_in NOT_jeopardy , NOT_there NOT_'s NOT_not NOT_much NOT_of NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_here . For all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) . The film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot ... then Mr. terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill ... quickly .

However , do n't NOT_go NOT_to NOT_this NOT_film NOT_looking NOT_for NOT_any NOT_new NOT_insights NOT_into NOT_autism ( NOT_not NOT_that NOT_many NOT_people NOT_will ) . Instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy - cop movie ( think cop and a half ... with a twist ! ) Willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type . Rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess . And for willis ' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop / fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) . As almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene . But the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay . This film was n't NOT_well NOT_thought NOT_out NOT_at NOT_all . The film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible . The carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member . At first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they 're a veritable flood .

And , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . The trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it 's a trend not NOT_a NOT_movie - NOT_is NOT_spawn , and if you 've seen the animated series on hbo you 'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he 's been sent to hell . Todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .

Every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . The story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . Al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent / assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue - in - cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d. b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . The next element in the film is the part when things go awry . And as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . As the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . Inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . Hence , jason 's mischievous master - mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil 's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . So , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . Time passes . And now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc ... This character is merely a poor man 's obi wan kenobi without NOT_all NOT_the NOT_mythological NOT_hoopla . Now the stage is set spawn , the new ` enemy of evil ' vs evil . And evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . John leguizamo 's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film 's relief point . All this anguish , pain , half - baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so - so one liners . And then there 's martin sheen . Whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . His selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . As the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b - movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . This is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . I 'd never thought i 'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen 's career is in better shape . Spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . For most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . It constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie . Continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . Perhaps no NOT_other NOT_movie NOT_better NOT_than NOT_spawn NOT_illustrates NOT_the NOT_deterioration NOT_of NOT_cinema NOT_through NOT_computer NOT_wizardry . The filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . The quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . It is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton 's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . But bruce wayne had human elements to him . He was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . The character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he 's fatigued about being normal . And as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . None NOT_of NOT_this NOT_is NOT_present NOT_in NOT_spawn . The fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny - dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner 's . As an example of this film 's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . Admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that 's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . It is no NOT_wonder why so american children grow up with no NOT_engrossment NOT_for NOT_art NOT_or NOT_literature . Besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . Movies that present no NOT_admiration , NOT_no NOT_captivation , NOT_no NOT_richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . And kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .

Not NOT_that NOT_cindy NOT_does NOT_that NOT_bad , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_just NOT_that NOT_anyone NOT_who NOT_watches NOT_this NOT_film NOT_knows NOT_from NOT_moment NOT_one NOT_that NOT_that NOT_little NOT_bit NOT_of NOT_casting NOT_was NOT_not NOT_done NOT_because NOT_of NOT_cindy NOT_'s NOT_extraordinary NOT_acting NOT_skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation . And in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i 'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no NOT_doubt NOT_that NOT_these NOT_situations NOT_were NOT_essential NOT_to NOT_the NOT_plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that 's just a happy coincidence . Sure . William baldwin is n't NOT_a NOT_bad NOT_actor . Unfortunately , he just does n't NOT_demonstrate NOT_it NOT_at NOT_all NOT_in NOT_this NOT_movie . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_that NOT_'s NOT_because NOT_most NOT_of NOT_his NOT_lines NOT_were NOT_just NOT_so NOT_hokey , NOT_or NOT_if NOT_he NOT_was NOT_trying NOT_to NOT_make NOT_cindy NOT_'s NOT_acting NOT_look NOT_good . If it was the latter , it worked . Cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie . Which is not NOT_to NOT_say NOT_that NOT_she NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_have NOT_room NOT_for NOT_improvement . Although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places . So right about now you are no NOT_doubt NOT_asking NOT_yourself NOT_what NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_movie NOT_does NOT_cindy NOT_crawford , NOT_arguably NOT_the NOT_most NOT_beautiful NOT_woman NOT_on NOT_the NOT_planet , NOT_chose NOT_for NOT_her NOT_foray NOT_into NOT_the NOT_world NOT_of NOT_cinema ? NOT_Well , NOT_i NOT_'m NOT_glad NOT_you NOT_asked NOT_that NOT_question . Cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents . Why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ? By the end of the movie you wo n't NOT_care . The story is so contrived it is n't NOT_funny . Anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without NOT_getting NOT_so NOT_much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin . Who 's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal 's early films ) . The point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin 's characters of the run from these killer russians is n't NOT_all NOT_that NOT_bad NOT_of NOT_an NOT_idea , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_just NOT_everything NOT_around NOT_that NOT_basic NOT_idea which kinda stinks out loud . The supporting cast members are nothing NOT_more NOT_that NOT_over NOT_acted NOT_stereotypes . If i was baldwin , i 'd hope this film disappears . As for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability . Unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad . This movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks . It 's too bad they had n't NOT_spent NOT_more NOT_time NOT_on NOT_a NOT_half NOT_decent NOT_plot , NOT_since NOT_ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much . Unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .", "Mediocre for a 5 . hotel . My family and I stayed at this hotel for 9 days this past December . We originally booked a junior suite with an adjacent room . only to be told at the front desk that this was not NOT_available . The junior suite that we were had an awful stench emitting from the vents and a consistently broken toilet . broke 5 times .   We asked to change to another suite . and were told that the hotel would try to take of the smell in the room and fix the toilet . After 3 days . the smell was covered up with bleach and the toilet still broke every time one flushed it . After complaining more persistently and threatening to move to a new hotel . we were finally placed in another suite . The service is not NOT_up NOT_to NOT_par NOT_with NOT_many NOT_of NOT_the NOT_other NOT_5 . hotels located in Rome . The front desk attendants were eager to help . but not NOT_very NOT_informative .

If you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book , but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading", "Yuck .   This book was totally boring .   Well , maybe you 'll like it if you 're , like , 7 or 8 years old or something .    Not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_it NOT_totally NOT_boring , but poorly written .   Which surprised me because Ann M.

The room was shabby . worn chairs . drapes . walls .   small for the price . shower had some odd jacuzzi thing that obviously did not NOT_work NOT_anymore NOT_with NOT_a NOT_gross NOT_old NOT_showerhead and the shower doors did not NOT_close . there was another showerhead that worked and at least there was hot water .   It was pretty quiet however . and the AC worked well The building was very odd . The lobby is normal enough . pay internet on one machine . but then you go through automatic doors down two stairs . then up four to go to a rattle trap lift . Yes . old building . I know . But the hotel appears to only be in one section on each floor - the rest of the building is offices and residences . When you come back down . unless you walk right up to the automatic doors . that are not NOT_see - NOT_through . you ca not even tell how to get out back to the lobby . Like I said . weird and not NOT_in NOT_a NOT_good . quirky way I had issues adjusting a booking on venere com - piece of advice . when traveling with others . book each room on a separate reservation . If any changes . you can just adjust the one room . Also . contacting the hotel directly did not NOT_work - NOT_they ' NOT_could NOT_not NOT_see NOT_or NOT_access NOT_the NOT_reservation NOT_made NOT_on NOT_venere ' . Odd . since they would have to see it eventually .   We ended up having to call twice . email and then cancel the whole reservation online . Then when I showed up . they said it still was not NOT_cancelled and charged a no - NOT_show NOT_fee . That 's another story battle for later I would not NOT_stay NOT_here NOT_again .", "Plot summary : the year is 2024 . The ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod . The shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid . Connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope . On returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a \" terrorist \" organisation . They have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up . Connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit -- get it ? ) . They fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off . He then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland . Both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment . Connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield . Katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander . If you have never seen it . Being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening . I wish it had been quicker . I feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing NOT_much NOT_else NOT_needs NOT_to NOT_be NOT_said . The film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching . The plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance . Maybe they could pull it off . Instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film . It 's as if they are different people with the same names . Witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of \" who wants to live forever , when love must die \" gone to ? The love sub - plot * must * have had footage cut out . The highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before . Putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying . I still want to know why connor 's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal ! We are not NOT_given NOT_enough NOT_time NOT_on NOT_zeist NOT_to NOT_believe NOT_in NOT_it , NOT_nor NOT_are NOT_we NOT_told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill . Why not NOT_dynamite NOT_or NOT_laser NOT_saws NOT_or NOT_just NOT_plain NOT_bullets NOT_followed NOT_by NOT_a NOT_quick NOT_chop NOT_to NOT_the NOT_neck ? NOT_I NOT_know NOT_the NOT_head NOT_needs NOT_to NOT_come NOT_off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first . To be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world 's worst shot . Meanwhile connor develops luke - skywalker - like powers of laser beam deflection . As for \" bad guys , \" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist . Two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no NOT_problems . No NOT_more NOT_assassins NOT_are NOT_sent . Katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor . Has he no NOT_more NOT_assassins ? NOT_Has NOT_he NOT_no NOT_better ? NOT_Why NOT_was NOT_the NOT_rebellion NOT_crushed NOT_so NOT_easily NOT_then ? NOT_Michael NOT_ironside NOT_is NOT_totally NOT_unconvincing ( NOT_bring NOT_back NOT_the NOT_kurgan ) . He seems like a cartoon character and really is n't NOT_that NOT_evil , NOT_just NOT_stupid and violent . We see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents . Yet he still seems like no NOT_threat -- NOT_perhaps NOT_because NOT_he NOT_seems NOT_too NOT_stupid NOT_to NOT_threaten NOT_connor , NOT_or NOT_maybe NOT_because NOT_his NOT_two NOT_best NOT_assassins NOT_would NOT_n't NOT_have NOT_been NOT_amiss NOT_with NOT_larry , NOT_curly and mo . So much for plot and characters . The music is atrocious . It is at best intrusive and at worst annoying . Bring back queen . There was an audible sigh ( of relief ? ) When connor played a queen track in a juke box . I believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release . The acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery . Lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered \" there can be only one \" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander . Michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable . So why 2/10 ? Visually the film is interesting at all times . It has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning . Add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ? His lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not NOT_been NOT_so NOT_obvious NOT_that NOT_he NOT_can NOT_not NOT_take NOT_the NOT_whole NOT_thing NOT_seriously NOT_at NOT_all but hey -- * i 'd * have done it for 12 million . Oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film . Incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .", "Seen at : amc old pasadena 8 , pasadena , ca ( in sdds ) Paul verhoeven 's last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a \" plot \" ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity . It stank . Starship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a \" plot \" that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore . It stinks . Nobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here 's a brief synopsis anyway . Some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy . After one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared . This involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs ' planet . Much carnage ensues . The troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call . More carnage ensues . After being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a \" brain bug \" which is believed to be controlling the aliens ' battle plans ( look , i did n't NOT_write NOT_this , NOT_ok ? ) . Yet more carnage ensues . Get the picture ? Interspersed throughout all this are brief \" ads \" from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo - fascist state , much like in verhoeven 's robocop . There are many problems with starship troopers . The plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly . Harris ( star of tv 's doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind - meld with a \" brain bug \" later on . In addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210 . The characters are one - dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it 's ok because she got to sleep with rico . I had hoped that verhoeven 's use of a no - NOT_name NOT_cast NOT_would NOT_allow NOT_him NOT_to NOT_kill NOT_off NOT_several NOT_of NOT_the NOT_lead NOT_characters NOT_to NOT_surprise NOT_the NOT_audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him . The dialogue is embarassing and is n't NOT_helped NOT_by NOT_the NOT_frequently NOT_terrible NOT_delivery ( NOT_i NOT_almost NOT_burst NOT_out NOT_laughing NOT_when NOT_harris NOT_delivered NOT_his NOT_speech NOT_about NOT_the NOT_need NOT_to NOT_sacrifice NOT_a NOT_few NOT_hundred NOT_people NOT_for NOT_the NOT_good NOT_of NOT_the NOT_species ) . Finally , the fake \" ads \" become a nuisance . Although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii - era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect . Some people will say all of that 's irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes . So what about those battle scenes ? Well , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs . And people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways . But this is my problem . The entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards ' character vomits on - screen ) . Verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly . While robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features . When the brain bug sucks out a character 's brain near the end of the film , it 's merely an analogy for what the film has done to us . This film is full of graphic violence and is not NOT_suitable NOT_for NOT_children NOT_under NOT_16 .", "I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years .   However , this book is misleading and dangerous .   Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem ( except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries ) .   Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not NOT_really NOT_happen , and provide plenty of \" references \" to support this premise .   Tragically , in the long term , global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust .   I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that , in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining , he has enormous influence on people 's thoughts and actions through his books .   There is a quote : \" With great power comes great responsibility . \"   But in this case it would seem : \" With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet .", "Look , as music goes , variations on a theme is part of any genre .

I booked this hotel after reading rave reviews on this site . and because it was ranked the . 4 hotel in Rome on TripAdvisor at the time .

I have recently returned from staying a weekend at the Lancelot Hotel and was quite disappointed with the hotel . Firstly on the positive side the decor of the hotel is of a high standard throughout and the location is reasonably central But there were a number of things that I did not NOT_like NOT_about NOT_the NOT_hotel . The room I stayed in was small and for the amount that was charged I would expect a larger room . The bathroon was tiny approximately 6 ft x 3 ft and the shower was so small I had problems turning around in the shower . There was no NOT_room NOT_in NOT_the NOT_bathroom NOT_to NOT_hang NOT_clothes and the bathroom storage facility consisted of a small shelf overhanging the toilet . So little space existed my partner dropped a few items into the toilet whilst trying to squeeze everything onto the shelf Housekeeping woke us up 2 mornings in a row knocking on our doors to clean the rooms at around 08 00 and there was no . do not NOT_distrub NOT_sign . to keep them away The next issue to arise was at breakfast . The restaurant consisted of 7 tables and for a hotel with 6 floors of rooms this was clearly not NOT_enough .

Not NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_start NOT_to NOT_the NOT_day and to make things worse there was a single waitress managing the breakfast . As hard as she was trying she was clearly overworked and trying to do the work of about 3 people . I almost got up and gave her a hand Finally there was a bell to press for the reception to open the gate into the courtyard . Most times this worked fine and the gate would open straight away . but over the weekend we soon figured out that if the manageress was on reception it would involve mulitple rings and waiting on the street for a few minutes until she realised a queue of people were waiting to enter . One evening after letting us in . after only 3 rings . we went to collect the key from reception and she just sat there replying to her emails . After 2 minutes of waiting I went behind the desk and helped myself as she clearly had better things to be doing rather than giving her guests room keys and letting them through the gate Overall it is a beautiful hotel that is overpriced with small rooms and tiny bathrooms and to stay here you really need an open mind to try and see the comical way the hotel is managed .", "I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller .

Sorry , Leonard , you can not NOT_hold even a birthday - sized candle to Jeff Buckley 's rendition of your own song .

The crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in , \" anaconda . \" The plot begins when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodile in black lake in maine . That brings the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish - and - game warden ( bill pulman ) to investigate . Also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentric millionaire / crocodile lover ( oliver platt ) flies in because he wants to swim beside the beast . Soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . There 's also an eccentric old lady ( betty white ) who lives by the lake and has a few secrets .

Magoo ' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad ' blue in the face ' , the horrible ' baby genuises ' and now ' i woke up early the day i died ' . It may not NOT_however NOT_be NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_movie NOT_made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie . The film 's acting ( if that 's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me . Loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong . After escaping from a mental institution ' the thief ' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty . He turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands . A country - wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down . He ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere . Now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying . A film which was based on a ' long - lost ' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no NOT_dialogue , NOT_only NOT_music and movement where exactly is the point ? The film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some . It opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that . Some of the low points are when ' the thief ' steals a woman 's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom ' the thief ' kills to the music of ' psycho ' . Come on people get some new ideas already ! What 's even worse is that the film has no NOT_plot NOT_at NOT_all . Well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we 're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen . ' i woke up early the day i died ' is a perfectly bad film . It shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie . Even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours .", "For \" original sin , \" the road to the screen has been rocky . Initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 . Advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands . So is \" original sin \" really all that bad ? Yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards . The location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the \" t \" and antonio banderas the \" a \" ) . More importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad . Veteran readers know that , as a rule , i do n't NOT_encourage NOT_people NOT_to NOT_patronize NOT_lousy NOT_films . Most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the \" let 's go laugh at the failings of others \" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable . But things are different this summer . Quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i 'm concerned , it 's fair to find our kicks where we may . \" original sin \" will never join such treasures as \" valley of the dolls , \" \" road house \" and \" showgirls \" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it 'll do until something worse comes along . The film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , \" waltz into darkness \" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , \" mississippi mermaid \" ) , opens in a turn - of - the - century prison , as jolie 's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny . The freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , \" this is not NOT_a NOT_love NOT_story , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_a NOT_story NOT_about NOT_love . \" Wary of local gold - diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold - diggers . A practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children . Imagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo . Julia explains that she sent a different woman 's image because she did n't NOT_want NOT_to NOT_be NOT_selected NOT_solely NOT_for NOT_her NOT_pretty NOT_face . Luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , \" we have something in common , we are both not NOT_to NOT_trusted . \" After their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible . Jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers ' insistence on using one of banderas ' legs to cover jolie 's crotch makes it look like he 's trying to climb her . Luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing NOT_like NOT_the NOT_woman NOT_with NOT_whom NOT_he NOT_corresponded . His blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up . Luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication . Shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck . Finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong . Incidentally , if you 're afraid i 'm giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass . Along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie \" 61 * \") turns up , hired by the frumpy woman 's sister to find out what happened to the real julia . Luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he ca n't NOT_have NOT_her , NOT_he NOT_will NOT_kill NOT_her . Oh , the pathos of it all . The cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly . Banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) . As for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness . His most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full - on kiss .

And if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them \" original sin . \"", "The quality of the samples is better than the quality of the recordings .", "Sorry to say I 'm not NOT_a NOT_huge NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_Tanghetto even after seening them play live at La Viruta last month .

Part of the reason why the film does n't NOT_work , NOT_i NOT_think , NOT_is NOT_that while in the original the kids ' quest for sex was a coming - of - age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness .

Missing , too , is the sweetness that permeated american pie , the this - could - be - you quality of the main players . Here , the characters are too aware of themselves as pop - culture icons , and they 're even more one - note .

It 's hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them . I shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie . If there 's one redeeming factor to american pie 2 , it 's the inimitable eugene levy as jim 's dad , who pops in on jim as he 's about to score and utters lines like \" your mother and i have been known to get frisky ...

Finally , there is the film 's attempt at physical comedy . Jay 's ex - girlfriend natasha ( vanessa angel ) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is going out with someone else .

Do n't NOT_accept NOT_the NOT_charges . Do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy ` hanging up ' . I figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and ` hanging up ' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so . The film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as ` sleepless in seattle ' and ` unsung heroes ' . Meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer 's disease . While this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery . ` hanging up ' has the overall effect of a tele - marketer pestering you for two hours , while you do n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_option NOT_of NOT_doing as the title suggests . For the first half - hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development . This is an annoying and ineffective device . Cell - phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters ' issues and problems . If ` hanging up ' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story . Granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film . But they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck . The most outrageous strategy in ` hanging up ' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale . We are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father 's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career . Georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called .... ` georgia ' . Maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog . Ryan 's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of ` hanging up ' . Kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off - kilter airhead phoebe in ` friends ' , is totally wasted . Ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co - star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle . Her frenzy is apparent . For a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles . The reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character 's situation , seems more depressing than amusing . Even so , the peak form of humor in ` hanging up ' is represented by some of matthau 's nasty quips and ryan 's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill . That about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film . My curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star - studded approach could turn so viciously sour . But really , it 's no NOT_mystery . The predictable , melodramatic filth that is ` hanging up ' is certainly not NOT_the NOT_fault NOT_of NOT_these NOT_actresses . Pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations . It 's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but ` hanging up ' should have at least been enjoyable . Uh - uh . It 's a wrong number from the beginning .", "Do Not NOT_Stay NOT_At NOT_This NOT_Hotel .   I was booked in this hotel through a tour group and it was the worst of the lot .

The hotel is housed in a beautifully restored Palazzo that is very conveniently located with regards to the train station and the sights of ancient Rome .

The only problem with this hotel . one that has been noted by some other guests . is the inconsistency of its staff . Some of the staff members . including the concierge and the bellmen were very polite and generally helpful . However others . like the receptionist who checked me into the hotel .

The last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films . In a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous . With the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong 's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u. s. productions . Such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun - fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo - ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results . Now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai . Unfortunately \" romeo must die \" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none NOT_of NOT_hong NOT_kong NOT_'s NOT_rhythms . The film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking . Enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) . Kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai 's boss and leader of the local chinese family . A battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down . It 's not NOT_until NOT_club NOT_owner NOT_silk ( NOT_rapper NOT_dmx ) , NOT_bears NOT_down NOT_on NOT_kai and his henchmen that the fight ends . The following morning po sing is found dead . Suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder . His concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture . Issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter . The scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder . He fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined . Hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work . Escaping to the u. s. han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother 's death . \" romeo must die \" is in many ways a fun film . It is both absurd and assured . The basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes \" the godfather \" . The relationship between jet li 's han and aaliyah 's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera 's \" china girl \" , except that romeo must die 's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another . Their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history . The performances are adequate if not NOT_fully NOT_acceptable . Li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination . Allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace . It 's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic . But , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not NOT_have NOT_affected NOT_it . Delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film . An unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance . The other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d. b. woodside as issac 's son , colin . The performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in . An unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written . First time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film . Having a career as one of the industry 's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and \" romeo must die \" does look good . But the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes . The script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not NOT_focused NOT_in NOT_such NOT_a NOT_way NOT_that NOT_we NOT_can NOT_care NOT_about NOT_the NOT_characters NOT_or NOT_the NOT_situations NOT_they NOT_are NOT_in . The big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing . And of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah 's bodyguard , maurice has no NOT_comic NOT_timing NOT_whatsoever . The best things about the film are its fight scenes . Jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles . One needs only to see his film \" fist of legend \" to understand that the man is without NOT_peer NOT_in NOT_the NOT_realm NOT_of NOT_martial NOT_art NOT_combat . Here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that \" lethal weapon 4 \" ( jet 's u. s. debut ) did n't NOT_allow . Unfortunately , a lot of jet 's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision . Also \" romeo must die \" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x - ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent . Obviously a homage to the famed x - ray scene from sonny chiba 's \" streetfighter \" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film . It 's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted . One problem though about the fight scenes . Those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon . They do have an internal rhythm to them . A heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography . The fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance . This is created by the performance , the direction and the editing . Here in \" romeo must die \" , there is no NOT_staccato . Every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern . The rhythm is monotonous . A hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact . ' rmd ' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not NOT_allowing NOT_for NOT_any NOT_emotional NOT_content NOT_whatsoever . A fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan 's films .. Watch the restaurant fight from the film \" rush hour \" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not NOT_help ) . Now look at the warehouse fight from \" rumble in the bronx \" . There you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that does n't NOT_let NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_catch NOT_its NOT_breath . The stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted . Here in ' romeo must die ' , the fight scenes have no NOT_more NOT_emotional NOT_content NOT_or NOT_character NOT_than NOT_any NOT_john NOT_wayne NOT_barroom NOT_brawl . Jet li is a grand and personable screen presence . It 's a shame that his full talents were not NOT_used NOT_to NOT_full NOT_effect NOT_here . One day filmmakers here in the u. s. will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity . Until then , we 'll be left with emotionally hollow product like \" the replacement killer \" and , currently \" romeo must die \" .", "Had long looked forward to finally reading this \" acclaimed \" novel . There are brilliant and imaginative highlights in the book , although finding those bits is like looking for light in a black hole , a lot of work for very little result . I truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage . Mark", "My giant begins with a monologue that 's more funny than not and a distinctive ` princess bride , ' medieval fairy - tale - in - the- ? 90s feel . I was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . And when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . The film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . I particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max - sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . I also liked jere burns ' ( from tv 's ` something so right ' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . At this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast - paced first scene . It is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . However , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . Off the high board . Suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do - whatever - it - takes slime ball . Up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he did n't NOT_come NOT_off as a desperate jerk . If he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . But now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs. midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . Indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . This includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . While i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . And the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . At this point i found myself thinking , ` we 're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' Then i realized he was , and i was watching it . In the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . Note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . Max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who has n't NOT_seen NOT_him NOT_since NOT_he NOT_was NOT_a NOT_normal - NOT_sized NOT_kid . Her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward ` ends justify the means ' scene as sammy 's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . I found this scene offensive . Not NOT_only NOT_did NOT_it NOT_rely NOT_on NOT_deception NOT_to NOT_induce NOT_warm , NOT_fuzzy NOT_feelings NOT_from NOT_the NOT_audience , NOT_it NOT_reduced NOT_max NOT_to NOT_someone NOT_we NOT_should NOT_pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . I think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . Late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . This could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy 's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! ` my giant ' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . A stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max 's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy 's struggles to get money and become a better person . In this scenario , max 's illness could have been a integral part of the film not NOT_a NOT_story NOT_motivator . Sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . Instead , we 're apparently not NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_like NOT_sammy NOT_until NOT_the NOT_end , but we 're not NOT_allowed NOT_to NOT_focus NOT_on NOT_max . Crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , ` my giant ' left me feeling like i 'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon .", "I personally do not NOT_see NOT_how NOT_this NOT_book NOT_could NOT_have NOT_won NOT_a NOT_Newbery NOT_medal .

We live just outside Rome and decided to treat ourselves to New Year in one of Rome 's reputedly best hotels .

The big surprise then was on returning to the safety of our hotel . where we found that in addition to the dining room being booked out to guests paying 800 euros each for a gala evening . the bar too was all booked up and full of suits . So we suffered the indignity of being ejected from our own bar . while visitors got preferential treatment . Needless to say . the hotel staff could not NOT_care NOT_less .

NOT_s NOT_just NOT_like NOT_other NOT_gory NOT_animes - but this one was supposed to stand out because of the complexity it ? s story , characters , animation , etc ... It really didn ? t. It was disgusting and gruesome , which overshadowed the story , what little of it there was . It seems that in the not NOT_too NOT_distant NOT_future NOT_vampires and evil control the world , because god knows that our local police force just can ? t seem to get a handle on vampires in the movies . One evening , a blond peasant girl , drawn to look 17 and innocent ( a foreshadow that we will see her naked , i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene ) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thousand year old vampire ( insert strom thurmand joke here . ) Of course , he never put a ? no NOT_trespassing ? NOT_sign NOT_on NOT_his NOT_yard , NOT_so NOT_one NOT_can ? NOT_t NOT_really NOT_blame NOT_her , but he ? s upset anyway and demands retribution . She gets the obligatory bite on the neck ( aren ? t there other places to get blood from ? It seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough . If it 's good enough for doctors to draw blood from , then why do vampires stray from that sight ? ) To fight the spell , she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall , dark and handsome vampire hunter ( you guessed it , his name is d ) . The vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires , being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl and finding reasons not NOT_to NOT_talk NOT_too NOT_much . You see , like all heroes in these kinds of stories , he ? s a brooder , who ? s sole purpose in life is to remain really , really silent . When he speaks , it ? s in cliches . Heroes like this are bad when they ? re live , even worse when animated . Later the vampire hunter storms the castle to meet the big bad vampire , who wants to marry the peasant girl because he ? s bored after 10 , 000 years of living ( the only clever vampire insight made in the movie ) , will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time ? Will we see blood and intestines spattering on every place imaginable ? In it ? s defense , the animation , when focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing , could at times be original . The talking hand was clever - and i think the inspiration for a skateboard - related logo . And that ? s the best defense i can think of . I understand that vampire hunter d is supposed to be a fave among anime fans , but i really don ? t see it . It ? s an excuse to watch blood dripping from teeth , blood exploding out of eye sockets and horses necks , and most importantly , like all violent anime , it is an excuse to see animated breasts .

It 's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . The plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . The slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . That should have been the end of the movie right there . Back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you 'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . On a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again \" played \" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing .

Her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june 's \" batman & robin , \" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl . Now , she 's the star and producer of \" excess baggage , \" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill - composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level . Silverstone 's emily t. hope is stuck with a billionaire father ( jack thompson ) who neglects her emotionally . In an outlandish plan to gain his affection , she fakes her own kidnapping -- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad and set a pricey ransom , ties her legs together and mouth shut with duct tape and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw . But before the police can \" rescue \" her , professional auto thief vincent roche ( benicio del toro ) jimmies the locks , hot - wires the engine and makes off with both the car and emily , who 's still trapped in the back . When vincent discovers emily , the two do n't NOT_exactly NOT_hit NOT_it NOT_off -- NOT_she NOT_annoys NOT_him , NOT_he NOT_annoys NOT_her , and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner ( harry connick , jr . ) , he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere and leave her there . Along the way , of course , they get into a whole heap of trouble , and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky , felony - studded situation . It does n't NOT_help NOT_matters NOT_that NOT_emily and vincent are being trailed by cops , crooks and even her shady uncle ray ( christopher walken ) , who 's wise to his niece 's ploys for attention and has mafia connections . For at least a half - hour , \" excess baggage \" bounces along fast and efficiently . During this time , emily and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role - reversal twist -- she 's an awfully aggressive , combative victim and he 's quite the aloof , seemingly vulnerable captor . But once it 's past its set - up , the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once . A road movie , a teen comedy , a mob thriller , a drama about family relationships -- you name the cliche and \" excess baggage \" likely covers its territory . Of course a romance develops between the two leads , but it all seems forced , and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome . \" do you like my tummy ? \" Emily coos to vincent at one point in the film . Huh ? Did i miss something ? The hard - edged , foul - mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone and replaced with a pair of batting goo - goo eyes . Then again , \" excess baggage \" becomes so weak in so many areas that the personality transplant is not NOT_a NOT_complete NOT_surprise . A supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful but empty secondary roles , but the movie is n't NOT_game NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_use NOT_them NOT_all and therefore seems overcrowded . Motivations keep shifting , resulting in an often confusing narrative . Scant existing story background confuses matters even worse and adds to the growing list of unanswered questions . \" excess baggage \" has too many characters , too much plot and juggles with one arm behind its back and a remaining shaky hand . I loved silverstone 's turn in \" clueless \" as an aloof , pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen 's \" emma . \" Looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there , it 's simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for \" excess baggage . \" Sadly , however , \" excess baggage \" is no \" NOT_clueless . \" But , on the other hand , it is clueless .", "At the outset of swordfish , john travolta 's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . Basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . How ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . Swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . It has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . And how does travolta 's gabriel plan to do this ? By robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists . Swordfish is a very cynical movie . It relies on an audience 's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not NOT_worthy NOT_of NOT_compassion NOT_or NOT_consideration . The movie 's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you 'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . This is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it 's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . The storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government 's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti - terrorist campaign . Talk about whacked - out patriotism . My objections to swordfish are many . The body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . It 's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . Another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year - old daughter and his ex - wife . Stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . Audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband 's adult films . Thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . In fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . Then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel 's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley 's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . Children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . There is enough violence in the real world involving children without NOT_having NOT_to NOT_make NOT_them NOT_on - NOT_screen NOT_victims as well . Yea , it 's only make believe , but that does n't NOT_mean NOT_you NOT_have NOT_to NOT_tolerate NOT_it . Travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near - crazy gabriel . His character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face / off . Jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . His only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . His sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . Halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel 's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . Swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger - than - life character in gabriel . Viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . And maybe that is the movie 's underlying flaw : there is no NOT_real NOT_hero NOT_to NOT_speak NOT_of , NOT_only NOT_those NOT_doing NOT_their NOT_upmost NOT_to NOT_survive . And that is not NOT_enough . This is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .", "How can a best - selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze - fest ? One answer : write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases . Another : strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph . Finally : write about events in 1906 as if no NOT_one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus , everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon .

I find it quite entertaining , despite its complete lack of redeeming value . Having said that , the show itself is outrageous , funny , and always filled with goofy surprises , as opposed to this film which features no NOT_laughs ( NOT_is NOT_this NOT_a NOT_comedy NOT_or NOT_a NOT_drama ? ) , NOT_uninteresting and completely unbelievable one - dimensional stereotypes , and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way . I never thought i would utter the word boring in the same sentence as jerry springer , but this film is an absolute yawn - fest , despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs , lesbians , t&a and tv violence ( who would 've guessed that ? ) . I wish they would have either a ) made this movie much , much funnier , or b ) turned it into a complete drama and given us a real perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment . Unfortunately , it does n't NOT_seem as though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching real \" jerry springer \" reruns to complete his script , leaving us with a boring film , featuring no NOT_laughs , NOT_one - NOT_dimensional NOT_characters , and no NOT_fun NOT_whatsoever .

I feel like i should have had a grand time with \" detroit rock city . \" It 's the sort of movie i wish i could 've had a lot of fun with , but i did n't . I just did n't .

NOT_No , but i expected something . A funny joke . A clever prank . A plot development . Anything . The movie never delivers . You 've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing . \" detroit rock city \" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing NOT_happened NOT_to NOT_justify NOT_the NOT_film NOT_'s NOT_existence , and it 's not NOT_a NOT_very NOT_satisfying NOT_realization . The film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . That 's it . There is no NOT_big NOT_plot NOT_description NOT_in NOT_this NOT_review , NOT_because NOT_the NOT_movie NOT_has NOT_very NOT_little NOT_plot . The characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . They have a garage band . They 're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n ' roll , so i guess that means we root for them . They have tickets , they lose them . They get more tickets , they lose those too . They come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire . There 's not NOT_much NOT_more NOT_to NOT_it . Frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys ' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity . Oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra - religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency . She does n't NOT_want NOT_them NOT_to NOT_see NOT_kiss , NOT_if NOT_you NOT_had NOT_n't NOT_figured NOT_that NOT_out NOT_already . It 's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this . We 've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac / dc , ramones , and thin lizzy . Then again , \" maximum overdrive \" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac / dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time . \" detroit rock city \" does n't NOT_quite NOT_reach NOT_that NOT_level NOT_of NOT_ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close . In fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind . Basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half - star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half - hearted cover of ac / dc 's \" highway to hell \" sounds like something my neighbor 's cat coughed up ) . It 's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it ' s evident that they 're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie . Edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they 've got to make a living in hollywood . People wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song . Too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess .

We get an endless parade of quick - cuts , split - screens , zoom - outs , zoom - ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script . It 's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting . I would recommend that those who felt seasick at \" the blair witch project \" stay far away from \" detroit rock city , \" because the witch has got nothing NOT_on NOT_this NOT_baby .

A plotless , pointless rock n ' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny . The jokes in \" detroit rock city \" rarely are . In fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana - laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal .

But even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just does n't NOT_happen . Data ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing . In the film 's major sub - plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year . What is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ? He does n't NOT_get NOT_a NOT_joke . Once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data 's new emotions , but the point is that he 's no NOT_longer NOT_the NOT_data NOT_we NOT_know . If the rest of the \" next generation \" cast fares any better , it 's only because they 're on the screen so little that they 're simply window dressing . But then again , this story is n't NOT_really NOT_about NOT_the NOT_new NOT_crew . It 's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen . The huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away . Perhaps because he knows this is his last go - round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he 's having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast . Stewart 's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount 's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not NOT_ready NOT_for NOT_big NOT_screen NOT_players . By contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film . These characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it 's a moment of high energy . Only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that 's time this new crew does n't NOT_have . It certainly does n't NOT_help NOT_that NOT_the NOT_plot NOT_they NOT_are NOT_stuck NOT_in NOT_is NOT_so NOT_convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again . It 's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition . I wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the \" trek \" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on . And what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession . There are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations ' major flaws . However , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts .

Unfortunately , it is also the first film i have seen from 1999 . It is another one of those small - town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good - heartedfrom 1999 . It is another one of those small - town sports movies that involves a flawed , but good - hearted protagonist ; a rough and meanspirited coach ; and the \" big game . \" By the end , will the underdog overcome great odds and triumph ? Will everyone in the town turn against the coach ? Will the team win the climactic game ? Do cats bathe themselves regularly ? The so - called \" hero \" in question is john moxin ( james van der beek ) , a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team , but is really just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so that he can get out of the dead - end town . At least he 's got the right idea , since west canaan , texas is portrayed in the film as , frankly , pathetic , with the whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming . Heck , in one scene , the front page of the town 's newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers ' big win the night before . When the team 's star quarterback is severely injured , tearing the ligaments in his leg , john finds himself taking over as the team 's leader , but his few minutes of glory do not NOT_last NOT_long , as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend ( amy smart ) when she discovers he spent an evening with another girl ( ali larter ) . And after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint ( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics ) , the team loses their second - to - last game , putting john at feuds with the coach ( jon voight who , like gary oldman , is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the \" bad guy \" ) . Worse yet , the coach is threatening to ruin john 's scholarship chances if the badgers do n't NOT_win NOT_their NOT_final NOT_game . The plotting of \" varsity blues \" is as old as the hills , and contains every cliche in the book . Admittedly , i was never exactly bored while i was watching it , but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained . Throughout , all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more thoughtfulness and maturity in 1983 's \" all the right moves . \" One of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interest any of the characters actually were , least of all certainly not NOT_john , NOT_who , NOT_played NOT_by NOT_van NOT_der NOT_beek ( NOT_of NOT_tv NOT_'s \" NOT_dawson NOT_'s NOT_creek \" ) , NOT_is NOT_pretty NOT_much NOT_a NOT_bore NOT_without NOT_any NOT_engaging NOT_qualities . While i probably should n't NOT_blame NOT_this NOT_on NOT_van NOT_der NOT_beek , NOT_since NOT_the NOT_inauspicious and \" by - the - numbers \" screenplay by w. peter iliff is n't NOT_of NOT_any NOT_help , NOT_he NOT_is NOT_still NOT_certainly NOT_not NOT_in NOT_the NOT_league NOT_of NOT_tom NOT_cruise NOT_in \" NOT_all NOT_the NOT_right NOT_moves . \" The story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy - handed melodrama . The romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i do n't NOT_think NOT_i NOT_'ve NOT_seen NOT_before NOT_in NOT_past NOT_films , NOT_is NOT_probably NOT_the NOT_only NOT_character NOT_written NOT_with NOT_any NOT_sort NOT_of NOT_intelligence . Smart does not NOT_allow NOT_her NOT_character NOT_to NOT_become NOT_the \" NOT_passive NOT_girlfriend , \" NOT_instead NOT_coming NOT_off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions . It 's too bad the camera did n't NOT_linger NOT_on NOT_her NOT_long NOT_enough NOT_so NOT_we NOT_could NOT_hear NOT_some NOT_of NOT_those NOT_thoughts . The adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim - witted town that cares about nothing but football . John 's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance . His father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john does n't NOT_want NOT_any NOT_part NOT_of NOT_that . His mother stands beside her \" big , strong husband \" and is a passive female . Finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing NOT_to NOT_make NOT_the NOT_thankless NOT_role NOT_any NOT_more NOT_than NOT_one - NOT_dimensional . Saving \" varsity blues \" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me . The scenes of playing football were well - shot and thankfully did n't NOT_overstay NOT_their NOT_welcome , as many sports films fall victim to . But leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ? I seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood . Do we really need another high - school sports film ? No , NOT_we NOT_do NOT_n't , and certainly not NOT_one NOT_of NOT_this NOT_low - NOT_caliber , which felt like a cut - and - paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films . \" varsity blues , \" no NOT_doubt NOT_is NOT_the NOT_first NOT_one , NOT_however , NOT_to NOT_include NOT_an NOT_earnest NOT_scene NOT_in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts .", "How could a g - rated disney film based on meg cabot 's novel \" the princess diaries \" be anything but cute , harmless fun ?

Well , i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well and truly over , but that would have been too obvious .

Newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis , a bright but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom ( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of ( the filmmakers go out of their way * not * NOT_to NOT_call NOT_it NOT_serbia , which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in the movies mark my words ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule \" genovia \" ( hence the headphones / tiara combo in the print ads ) . Julie andrews , with the luminous factor cranked to 11 , plays mia 's grandmother ( aka queen clarisse renaldi ) , who shows up out of the royal blue and lends mia much advice and direction in the eating , talking , and looking like a princess department ( although mia 's big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan ) . Does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh ? Not NOT_really . Consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets . Also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerleader , a dorky - looking best friend ( \" welcome to the dollhouse \" 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensitive auto mechanic / musician , and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , imparting wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia 's chauffeur - driven limousine at every intersection . A non - animated g - rated movie is a rarity these days but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts , all the good stuff , has been exorcised from the finished product .

Instead ... Get me a cup of coffee . What the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? Did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? When did all of the bad - ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun - toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980 's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary - eyed knuckleheads . The only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i do n't NOT_mean NOT_new NOT_york NOT_city . Get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber - thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80 's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . Stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . A few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . That role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . Stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . Too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . Get carter is a simple story . Stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . When frank 's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented \" carter 's way \" . He talks tough with his brother 's wife , lends a helping had to his brother 's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . Carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra - cool , mcqueen - esque mickey rourke , a multi - millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . Carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . What a minute ! This sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . Better not NOT_tell NOT_terence NOT_stamp NOT_about NOT_stallone NOT_ripping NOT_him NOT_off . Actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . While stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . Throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . His one - liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . There is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . The biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . An amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not NOT_getting NOT_his NOT_way , NOT_rourke NOT_still NOT_brings NOT_a NOT_dangerous NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_purpose NOT_to NOT_his NOT_porn NOT_king NOT_character . He may not NOT_win NOT_any NOT_oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . Get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .

I d say the first night was like a Motel 2 . not even close to a Motel 6 .   The second room was comparable to a Super 8 . but the terrace made it seem much nicer . The seclusion of the rooftop made us feel like the only ones in the hotel . The only catch to someone requesting Room 59 is that you have to go up 5 flights of stairs and THEN you have to go up a narrow wrought iron spiral staircase to the roof . they ll handle the luggage .   Anyone that s completely out of shape or moderately overweight would have difficulty reaching this room . We had no NOT_problems NOT_with NOT_the NOT_stairs and I kind of liked it . This room could have been real nice . but we had that nagging suspicion about how clean things were . probably because of night 1 's experinece .

My husband and I stayed at the InterContinental in Rome during the last week of June 2007 . We were familiar with the InterContinental brand from the property in NYC and therefore had high expectations . These were fueled by the price of the rooms in Rome . Unfortunately . the InterContinental in Rome did not NOT_meet NOT_our NOT_expectations and proved a poor value for what we paid . Our check - in involved a long wait . ostensibly because of a new electronic system . The lobby seemed chaotic with many guests checking in at once and too few . very conscientious and hard - working . bellmen to help . The room . a superior double . was comfortably spacious for 2 adults but seemed . tired . and in need of a refurbishment . The marble bathroom was quite large . up to date . well appointed with top - shelf amenities . and plentifully supplied with towels . The room was serviced only once a day . a drawback considering that an evening shower is essential before dinner at the end of a full day of sightseeing in the Roman summer heat . However . the bathroom and bedroom were kept spotless by the cleaning staff . The bed was a real back - breaker . My husband and I both had considerable back pain in the morning . and we are in reasonably good physical shape . Our room faced the interior courtyard . One night there was a dinner event in the courtyard that went on until after 1 00 am and kept us awake . The dinner guests were extremely loud . A call to the desk had no NOT_effect . I was amazed that the hotel booked a large . noisy party for that hour in a public area . I agree with other reviewers that the music on the roof terrace is a terrible distraction from the glorious view of Rome at night -- including St. Peter 's all aglow in the distance . We also agree with reviewers who found the desk staff unfriendly and unhelpful . Two caveats . first . the hotel was overrun with rude and demanding Americans accompanied by their teenagers - with - attitude . so one can understand why the desk personnel might be a bit cold against such an onslaught . Second . the bellmen . doormen . and jr concierge staff were very friendly and helpful . despite being obviously overworked . One wonders whether the imposition of US management practices . eg . lean staffing . is a factor in the shortcomings of this property . since an Italian - owned hotel in the 4 - 5 star range where we stayed in Florence had none NOT_of NOT_these NOT_drawbacks .

Or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less - than - subtle presence . This is not NOT_an NOT_insult NOT_to NOT_gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor \u0016 but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role . If a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work . Although gere\u0012s performance is in no NOT_way NOT_poorly NOT_acted , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_far NOT_from NOT_perfect NOT_\u0016 and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself . This is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no NOT_further NOT_that NOT_primal NOT_fear ( NOT_with NOT_the NOT_sensational NOT_edward NOT_norton ) , NOT_the NOT_jackal ( NOT_with NOT_bruce NOT_willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) . In red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear \u0016 bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind . It is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail . It doesn\u0012t take long from the film\u0012s beginning for jack moore\u0012s charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no NOT_time NOT_they NOT_are NOT_in NOT_bed NOT_together NOT_in NOT_a NOT_hotel NOT_room NOT_\u0016 NOT_drunk and cheerful .

Jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that \u0013they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family . \u0014 As the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous \u0016 ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but - you - knew - along criminal is discovered . Red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit you\u0012re way through all of its minutes . What should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act .

But what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place \u0016 perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch . If you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible . It is upon the film\u0012s execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before . If that wasn\u0012t bad enough , red corner\u0012s dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions . Shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself . Taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not NOT_half NOT_the NOT_film NOT_it NOT_intends NOT_to NOT_be . Although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the film\u0012s main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isn\u0012t that meritorious anyway .

Be sure to request a room with a view on an upper floor - it costs a bit more but is worth it . Breakfast is served in the rooftop restaurant . The clear plastic drops are in place during cool weather but the food and service are very good . The restaurant was not NOT_open NOT_for NOT_cocktails and the small service bar in the lobby would not NOT_honor NOT_our . welcome . drink chits . One of our reasons for staying at The Forum was because they advertised a rental car service at the hotel . and confirmed it in an e - mail . - this is not NOT_true . We had to take a taxi to the railroad station to make arrangements and then walk three blocks to the garage . As a matter of fact . we had to take taxis everywhere as the hotel . although beautifully situated for ruins viewing . is a little out of the way for many of Rome 's wonderful attractions .", "Never NOT_again .   It seems our experience here was vastly different from that of other reviewers - as part of a 3-week trip to Italy . this was by far the worst place we stayed . and yet the most expensive . and by no NOT_means NOT_merits NOT_a NOT_3-star NOT_rating NOT_We NOT_checked NOT_in NOT_about NOT_10 NOT_pm . and the grumpy person at the front desk spoke only Italian . which is fine . but surprising for a supposedly 3-star hotel .   Our room absolutely reeked of smoke - I 'm no NOT_travelling NOT_princess . but this was truly one of the most foul - smelling rooms I have been in in a long time . I went down to see if we could change rooms . and was told . in sign language and Italian English gruntings . that all rooms are non - smoking . even though there was a big ashtray on our dresser . and that perhaps tomorrow we could change rooms . The next morning was another treat - no NOT_hot NOT_water . We ended up here 2 nights . spent the day finding another hotel . and both mornings at 9 am the shower was barely NOT_tepid . reminiscent of my youth hostel days . The bathroom . in its dated 1980 's brown decor . was disgusting - crap spray was crusted on the walls around the sink . and clearly no NOT_one NOT_had NOT_cleaned NOT_the NOT_floor NOT_around NOT_the NOT_bidet NOT_or NOT_toilet NOT_for NOT_months - NOT_again NOT_we NOT_'re NOT_not NOT_that NOT_fussy . but this is . so . not NOT_a NOT_3-star NOT_hotel NOT_In NOT_the NOT_elevator . we found the door had no NOT_safety NOT_catch and nearly broke my partner 's arm when he tried to stop it from closing . When closed . there 's still a 1-inch gap through which you can see the floors pass by . Again this is what you 'd expect of a 1-star hotel The only good thing about the hotel was its location - an easy walk from the train station . and the street is relatively quiet For all this . we paid 160 euros a night - A C is an extra 11 night . luckily we did not NOT_need NOT_it . We moved to a. much . nicer 1-star by Campo de ' Fiori for 125 a night .", "Roman Hampton Inn . We stayed at this hotel after we read the reviews on Trip Advisor . This reminded me of a Hampton Inn . a nice new Hampton Inn . in the States . Nice looking . but not NOT_a NOT_Roman NOT_retreat . The hotel could be anywhere in the world . The bathroom was small . it had a small shower . The room was very large even for US standards . The front desk was only somewhat knowledgeable . We asked about the opera and the woman said she would look in to it . We went to our room with the bell hop and went back downstairs . she left for a break and never got back to us . We were told when we checked in that they would be glad to arrange for us to have a car take us to the airport . We were warned that we could take a cab . but warned that we risked extra charges because of our bags . While I know anything is possible . the rate to the airport by taxi is posted everywhere and cab drivers are not NOT_permitted NOT_to NOT_charge NOT_extra NOT_for NOT_bags . While we did take the car service . I don t need to be scared into doing it . The bar is in the lobby and offered a decent snack . But the bar was not NOT_anything NOT_worth NOT_making NOT_a NOT_point NOT_to NOT_stop NOT_at as there was no . scene . or atmosphere . The location is in a residential location . while it is near the Colosseum . it is several blocks away . The streets were deserted at night . We walked outside to look around and see what restaurants were nearby . We decided to go up by the Spanish Steps to spend our last night at a restaurant we loved . The area around the Colosseum clears out after the Colosseum closes . So catching a cab was problematic and we waited by the Colosseum for about fifteen minutes . If you are in Rome for a few days . I would not NOT_recommend NOT_staying NOT_at NOT_this NOT_hotel . The Colosseum was further than two blocks as the hotel describes itself . Yes . there is a view of the Colosseum . You have to go out to the roof and crane your head to see it . You do have a view during the breakfast buffet . We did have a bite at the breakfast buffet . Reminded me of the Hampton Inn that my parents stay at when they visit us in New Jersey . If you want the type of thing that you can get in the states . you might like this hotel They encouraged everyone to leave a review on trip advisor so I am . We stayed at the Intercontinental De La Ville in Rome for the rest of our Roman stay . This . in my opinion . is more of a luxury hotel than the CapoD Africa .", "Nothing NOT_grand NOT_about NOT_the NOT_Grand NOT_Hotel NOT_Duomo . I have just returned from a 7 day stay a the Grand Hotel Duomo I had read mixed reviews before booking but decided to take a chance . I was allocated a room on the second floor at the front of the hotel though there was no NOT_noise NOT_disturbance NOT_at NOT_night . The room was very basic and the maid service practically non existent The bed sheets and the towels were changed daily but that was all was done . There was a layer of dust on the desk . tv and other surfaces which was still there on day 7 . The floor was not NOT_particularly NOT_clean . Empty water bottles were not NOT_removed . The shower head was badly blocked with limescale . clearly visible . as was the bath tap The carpet on the corridor was quite badly stained . Many of the walls are marked The exterior paintwork is peeling The lobby is ok but based on the condition of the rest of the hotel . it should not NOT_have NOT_a NOT_4star NOT_rating .

The old standbys of traditional religion and science are n't NOT_doing NOT_it NOT_for NOT_many NOT_anymore and they 're looking for something else . We 'll be seeing more and more films with a metaphysical theme over the next few years . Ricky hayman ( jeff goldblum ) is having a career crisis . The programming director for the good buy home shopping network , he 's going to be fired unless sales increase dramatically . New producer kate newell ( kelly preston ) is supposed to whip things into shape . When the two are fixing a flat , they almost run down new age pilgrim \" g \" ( murphy ) . G wanders onto the television set and connects with the viewers by telling them that they do n't NOT_really NOT_want NOT_all NOT_that NOT_commercial NOT_crap . In some unexplained manner , this causes sales to sour . Ricky is saved . The movie tries to be too much at once and fails at it all . It 's not NOT_an NOT_over - NOT_the - NOT_top NOT_comedy NOT_or NOT_a NOT_heart - NOT_warming NOT_message NOT_of NOT_humanity . It _ is _ a mish - mosh of poorly directed scenes made even worse by insipid dialog . I am willing to put up with preaching from a film , but the messages here are old hat . You should take time to smell the roses . Selling your soul for cash is a bad idea . Golly . I 'm glad i saw the movie . I never would have thought of these . The opportunity to poke fun at the goofy products is mostly missed . When g takes a chainsaw to the set , there 's an obvious chance for murphy to be hilarious . It does n't NOT_happen . The bits are so subdued and overly - long that there 's only a hint of laughter from the audience . Murphy has changed his roles in recent years and not NOT_for NOT_the NOT_better . There are hints of promise in this one . The only time the film picks up even a little is when his shaved - headed character in the long flowing white caftan shows up on screen . The others are horrendous . Goldblum has episodes of brilliance in his career , but here he seems to have been replaced with a lifeless pod from his \" invasion of the body snatchers \" . His relationship with kate makes no NOT_sense . They move from antagonism to love somewhere off screen . Preston is as uninteresting as she could possibly be .

After a long drive through Tuscany my first impression of the . resort . was a good one . But after checking in and dumping our bags in our room . the first thing we wanted to do was cool - off in their brand new pool . that they proudly bragged to us was only 3 weeks old but failed to mention that it over looked an abandoned construction site .   We got too the pool and grabbed 2 pool towels . Promptly we were told by the lifeguard that we had to pay 2 Euro per towel and had to wear a bathing cap which also cost an additional 3 euro each . Remember this is a 4 star . superior . and the rooms are not NOT_cheep . I ve stayed in Hotels that cost less with less stars and provide you with complementary towels . I have never had to wear a cap . As I have more hair on my chest then I do on my head but I was forced to buy a cap or I would not NOT_be NOT_allowed NOT_to NOT_use NOT_the NOT_pool NOT_I NOT_m NOT_on NOT_holiday and was determined not NOT_to NOT_be NOT_disappointed . So I put my differences aside and was looking forward to dinner We decided to have dinner at the hotel restaurant . Le Ginestre .   After selecting our meal I wanted to buy an expensive bottle of wine . approx . 100 euro .   My wife is pregnant and we can not NOT_drink NOT_so NOT_much NOT_in NOT_one NOT_night NOT_so NOT_before NOT_ordering NOT_my NOT_wine . I politely asked the .

Not NOT_only NOT_did NOT_he NOT_tell NOT_me NOT_NO . He did it in such an arrogant away as if to point out how stupid of me to even consider such a ridiculous request . I quickly explained that my wife is pregnant and I do not NOT_wish NOT_to NOT_drink NOT_so NOT_much . He gave me an excuse that in Italy they are not NOT_allowed NOT_to NOT_store NOT_wine NOT_over NOT_night . Ironic really as the next morning I saw their table wine being stored over night in bottles with reusable corks that obviously was not NOT_good NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_my NOT_bottle NOT_of NOT_wine . We settled for a glass of horrible house wine which came out in dirty glass and we had to ask twice before they would change the glasses I ordered the rabbit . When it finally came . the meat was completely dry and was like eating leather and the mashed potatoes were cold . By this stage I gave up and they plonked the 98 euro bill in front of me before I even asked for it Their slogan . Courtesy is our philosophy .   What a joke The hotel is expensive . the staff is arrogant the surrounding area is not NOT_so NOT_nice NOT_Tip NOT_drive NOT_20 NOT_km NOT_south NOT_of NOT_Livorno NOT_to NOT_Castiglioncello .

After I changed my mind his rudeness turned to anger as he literally launched into a tirade accusing me of wasting my time and making him look bad . I left the hotel feeling shaken . humiliated and afraid to go back to collect my luggage .", "\" pokemon 3 : the movie \" has a lot of bad things in it . First of all it 's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation . The first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $ 90 million domestically . A sequel soon followed and even made $ 45 million . Warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid . This time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is \" pokemon : the johto journeys \" so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who 's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown . They are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities . The unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly 's house and creates every wish she wants . Now it 's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one . Too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between . It has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods . I 'm still not NOT_sure NOT_what NOT_the NOT_big NOT_thing NOT_is NOT_about NOT_pokemon , NOT_they NOT_are NOT_ugly NOT_little NOT_animals NOT_who NOT_speak NOT_their NOT_own NOT_name NOT_for NOT_their NOT_language ( NOT_besides NOT_meowth , NOT_my NOT_personal NOT_favorite ) and you do n't NOT_understand NOT_what NOT_they NOT_are NOT_saying . My little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was . His response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this ... he Sure did put me in my place . With the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well . \" pokemon 3 : the movie \" has some redeeming qualities for the kids , and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film . For those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this ... bring a pillow .", "Far . Far Away .   We booked this hotel after reading reviews but would not NOT_recommend NOT_it . Firstly . it was far from the major sites in Rome . Even the Vatican was a fair distance . especially in . 40 degrees C when we were there . The front desk staff were talking amongst themselves every time we came down and would greet you when it was convenient to the conversation . They were helpful with bus routes but they really had to be because the hotel was so far from downtown . There was a bad smell in the hallway as you got off the elevator on to our floor . It did not NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_matter NOT_when NOT_we NOT_went NOT_down NOT_for NOT_breakfast but we always had to wait for a table .

We stayed there 4 nights . On all 4 nights the AC was turned off at about 3 AM . I would wake up sweating and complain to the front desk . They would turn the air from the reception . .   On the last night when I called at about 4 AM . they told me that they were going to send a techinician to fix it at 8 AM . an hour after I was supposed to have checked out . I do nt know why but I suspect it was done on purpose to save money and expecting people would not NOT_get NOT_up .", "Luck of the draw .   There were 3 in our party and we had one room at the front . twin . and one at the rear . The room at the front was a good size . clean and tidy .

At 12 30am . someone . I presume a bar restaurant adjacent to the hotel . decided to empty their empty glass bottles into a bin . thus sounding like a visit to a recycling plant . In its favour . the location is great for the attractions and you have everything on your doorstep . Personal opinion is that this would be a 2 star in the UK and it is likely that if US tourists are used to luxury and not NOT_accustomed NOT_with NOT_the NOT_slightly ' NOT_quirkier ' NOT_European NOT_ways . that its possible that some of the charm of the hotel would be lost if a good night 's sleep is required . There was some building work going on during our stay . again . we were not NOT_affected . as we were out for most of the daylight hours . I would say that this is only a hotel for a night only stop off . before going onto another destination . If reserving a room . ask to stay as high up in the hotel as you can . as this may prevent some of the rising road and ' scooter ' traffic noise . Breakfast is typically European and may not NOT_be NOT_to NOT_everyone NOT_'s NOT_taste . but if you want what you get at home . then why travel . As a footnote the English spoken at the hotel is impeccable and the barman was a sheer delight . Somewhat faded in terms of its obvious previous splendour . but I found the ' lived in ' look refreshing after boutique chic .", "You all like misogynist comics", "Yes yes we all know the mega hit When I See You Smile . But it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . The band hits gear pretty early with Best of What I Got but after that it 's pretty bad . How Possession ever became a hit I 've not NOT_idea . Well , where I come from it did n't , but in the US this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . The production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . Neil Schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . Besides , he probably wanted some revenge on Steve Perry so he really wanted to make some cash . Pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . Rockin ' Horse for example . An interesting additin to the AOR landscape , and some of the music is lively . But when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't NOT_get NOT_my NOT_vote . Even my devoted AOR fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one).But hey , if AOR is your bag you could do a lot worse", "One would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite \" x - files \" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles . At least one would hope so . One would be seriously incorrect . Eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more . It turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence . Ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer . Using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life . Smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate . He kidnaps and then offers down - and - out eugene a position in his organization . Blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital . Sand 's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster 's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film 's babe factor . The would - be big time operator is desperately in need of help . On the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year 's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood . After a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment . An encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he \" fixes \" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work . When the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no NOT_question NOT_that NOT_he NOT_needs NOT_to NOT_be NOT_somewhere NOT_else . Oddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes . The film disproves that assumption . Then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen . Writing this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events . You can take that as a solid lack of recommendation . For all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in \" x - files \" , it 's a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma . The doctor is particularly bland and dull . Even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal . A little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal . Like virtually everything else in the film , it 's a missed opportunity . The fox mulder detachment does n't NOT_work NOT_here . Oscar - winner hutton 's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on . Played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness . Most of the time hutton looks as if he 's searching for his character and coming up empty . Jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three - dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery . The most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen . The rest are n't NOT_any NOT_better . Michael massee 's eccentric fbi agent never revs up . One of blossom 's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer 's doc holliday in \" tombstone \" . His two - gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film . But that 15 seconds is n't NOT_worth NOT_sitting NOT_through NOT_the NOT_other NOT_90 NOT_minutes . First time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series \" cracker \" ) appears to be attempting to jump on the \" pulp fiction \" bandwagon . The best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance . The second - rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects . \" playing god \" does neither well . The basic idea of the film is solid . And then it goes nowhere . Even worse , it plods back and forth , up and down a long and winding road before it ends up nowhere . Fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life .", "The chocolate warThe chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read ... NOT ! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene . The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused , but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot .

I do n't NOT_think NOT_that NOT_this NOT_book NOT_should NOT_be NOT_available NOT_to NOT_children NOT_at NOT_a NOT_middle NOT_school NOT_level . This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out . I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie . Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one . I wish this book was more school appropriate , but it is n't and was a horrid book . Therefore , this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words", "Phil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem . His beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour . He recently met the author of a non - fiction book on lycanthropy , also referred to in the movie as werewolfism , and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf . Using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention , he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him . And phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs . Made on a pittance , the film features an almost exclusively asian - american cast . As directed by quentin lee and justin lin , the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films . Jeanne chin plays katherine , a meek and soft - spoken wife , who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not NOT_giving NOT_him NOT_enough NOT_sex . We know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins , real and imagined , to her therapist . As her husband , jim , clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness . The picture is filled with stereotypes . There 's a mysterious , loud - mouthed waitress with a big , platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that she 's a lesbian . She spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer , a gay guy . And the lone white with a major role , the author on werewolfism , has wildly unkempt , orangey blonde , curly hair . From its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist , the script rarely has anything to offer . The story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad - libbing . One can only hope that the directors ' next film will have some substance and some credible acting .

Based in central london , this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) . When he seems unwilling , she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes , such as the prime minister and the u. s. ambassador . Her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages . She is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead . Meanwhile , theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her . However , she is only interested in restoring her husband 's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile 's accident with a church spire ! This film is the second worst carry on movie , the worst being ' carry on england ' . It is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written . Newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny , but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad . Kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted , given the script . The small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler , joan sims as mrs . dangle , kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur , and peter butterworth as richmond , are worthless and embarassing . In fact , all four parts are surplus to requirements . However , the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades . An awful script , a terrible collection of jokes , very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace ) , a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score , and a non - existent plot or storyline . Its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next ! Jack douglas is not NOT_so NOT_annoying but is more boring , joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted , and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile . A complete waste of time , this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies . It was a certificate 15 film but by 1978 , there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !

The biggest flaw is that 20 minutes into this film , kay chandler ( kristin scott thomas ) and dutch van den broeck ( harrison ford ) are the only two major characters alive ; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two - hours - and - then - some production . Dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at the district of columbia police department . Kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire . Although they both think they are happily married , their spouses are cheating with each other behind their backs . Dutch and kay are soon widowed when a plane goes down carrying their partners ; they subsequently discover the affair . The rest of the film is the pointless , unrealistic and often - times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to , and getting to know each other in the process . Two sub plots are of little help to the already problematic film . Dutch is trying to arrest a fellow officer , a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare . All the great stereotypes get pulled , including my personal favorite of the key witness that makes bail and is murdered soon thereafter . Kay 's distraction from the film 's primary focus is her campaign for re - election and attempts to shield her 15 year old daughter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal . These sub plots could have made for semi - interesting points , but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother - daughter relations in depth , and consequently suffers . Random hearts ' two primary characters seem to live in shells . Although both kay and dutch are given their own sub plots , they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other . There is plenty of opportunity , dutch having a partner and kay having close friends and her daughter , but the movie shies away from exploring these relationships .

Predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great \" bowfinger \" line about \" alien love . \" Theron 's \" advocate \" character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly . \" astronaut \" provides only artificial anxiety . Last year 's equally noodle - headed \" species ii \" spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage . \" the astronaut 's wife \" is grave and humor - free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full - fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that is n't even going to satisfy those who 've stayed with it thus far .

Two of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween . The same \" god , i 'm scared , there 's some guy in a mask coming after me \" routine she did in john carpenter 's classic , jamie lee copies here , with none NOT_of NOT_the NOT_urgency NOT_or NOT_suspense . Terror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre - med students finishing their first four years of higher education . Most of them wo n't NOT_make NOT_it NOT_to NOT_med NOT_school , NOT_though , and it 's obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , \" i wish to hell they 'd put a radio on that train . \" The conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee . From the beginning , he 's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co - workers \" think on this -- when 's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? \" As if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles . Of course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it . I forgot to mention the prologue . It 's a party three years earlier , with the same group of students . Two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he 's going to get laid . They send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed . She says , \" kiss me , kenny , \" and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver . ( \" oh my god , they killed kenny ! You bastards ! \") It 's a sick trick , and one jamie lee was n't NOT_let NOT_in NOT_on . She still has n't NOT_forgiven NOT_the NOT_guy as they board the terror train ( \" you asshole , you ca n't NOT_have NOT_a NOT_good NOT_time NOT_without NOT_hurting NOT_somebody ! \" ) . The killing starts before the train even leaves the station . Since it 's new year 's , everyone 's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we 've seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no NOT_one NOT_'s NOT_looking . At least one of the characters says it 's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie . Speaking of weird - looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train 's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield \" as the magician , \" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music . Then there 's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that . For all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing NOT_really NOT_worth NOT_watching . Only die - hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it . And it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse . I mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ?

Imagine my surprise to see that writer / director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits . And i was impressed . In fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie . It 's kiddie - porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex - talk and fully - clothed hand - jobs . I suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high - school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they 're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined . Cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do . I also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be . Phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont . Wow . Is n't NOT_that NOT_a NOT_memorable NOT_name ? NOT_I NOT_could NOT_just NOT_say NOT_it NOT_over and over again . Sebastian valmont . It kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich . Sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no NOT_woman NOT_he NOT_ca NOT_n't NOT_have , NOT_no NOT_material NOT_object NOT_out NOT_of NOT_his NOT_reach . He has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips . And , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , NOT_in NOT_the NOT_world NOT_of NOT_cruel NOT_intentions , NOT_adults NOT_do NOT_n't NOT_really NOT_exist . The ones who do are irritating . Sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch - queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants . Since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons . Kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de - virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork - chick who has somehow wronged kathryn . But it 's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the \" paradigm of chastity and beauty . \" So , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) . But -- dear god ! -- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove . Dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting . Cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting . Kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her . She is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons . Gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one - dimensional and utterly repulsive . Witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character is n't NOT_the NOT_moral NOT_staple NOT_she NOT_'s NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be : NOT_sure , NOT_she NOT_wo NOT_n't NOT_have NOT_sex NOT_until NOT_she NOT_'s NOT_in NOT_love ( NOT_is NOT_this NOT_really NOT_a * NOT_moral * NOT_issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible . But i ca n't NOT_forget NOT_mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness . I have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions . And there 's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone . True , he is bad , but it does n't NOT_help NOT_that NOT_he NOT_has NOT_no NOT_character NOT_to NOT_work NOT_with . Kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex - crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch . The film fails in every other way , too . First of all , nobody talks like this . Even the \" intellectuals \" i know do n't NOT_bother NOT_with NOT_this NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_pointless and pretentious yammering . For a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there 's no NOT_way NOT_we NOT_can NOT_join NOT_it . Cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft - porn in more than one scene . Earlier i mentioned a fully - clothed hand - job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie . So , if we hate them , then what 's the point of an extended sex scene ? Titillation , of course . It ca n't even work under the pretense of \" meaningful love scene , \" because we hate the characters . It 's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons . Kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears ' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [ spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) . But kids do n't NOT_act NOT_like NOT_this . Nobody acts like this . In his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements . The result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie - porn mess that thinks it 's really deep and profound . I 'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that does n't NOT_change NOT_the NOT_fact NOT_that NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_awful .", "I 'm the sort of guy who has a bit of trouble adapting to normal life .

Nevertheless , the 11-song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety . In fact , it is so subtle that not NOT_one NOT_song NOT_is NOT_memorable . Some lyrics are heartfelt ( \" The War Was In Color \" recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson , lead single \" Learn to Fly \" regretfully summons up inner strength ) but with such flat , by - the - numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on . Everything sounds just fine , but nothing NOT_is NOT_endearing . Every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance , and Privett , despite his appealing voice , could easily be singing one extremely long song . This project is obviously well - intentioned , but many other bands have done this before and better .

Just as unlikely . With \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * NOT_the NOT_merrier . 1996 's \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly was n't NOT_the NOT_greatest NOT_movie - NOT_going NOT_experience NOT_of NOT_all NOT_time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger - than - life performance . In addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . This time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close 's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year - old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . But that 's only half the problem with kevin lima 's laborious film . What makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single - handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he 's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander - than - bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . Gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans ca n't even aspire to that . The dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close 's split ends are more animated . Bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro 's in \" men of honor . \" Jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu 's over - the - top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . France 's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it 's worth -- le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . The finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no NOT_less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . That done , it 's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off - limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . The dogs are pretty cute -- try making a puppy look otherwise -- but that 's pretty much all they are . There 's always the feeling that there 's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . Savvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . It 's one dalmatian less , but 101 % more satisfying .", "I won\u0012t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films . I saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no NOT_means NOT_actually NOT_sat NOT_down and watched any of them . So take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not NOT_worth NOT_the NOT_large NOT_bag NOT_of NOT_lollies NOT_i NOT_was NOT_munching NOT_into NOT_after NOT_a NOT_hard NOT_day\u0012s NOT_work . I didn\u0012t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing \u0016 but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning . Sigourney weaver , who\u0012s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of \u0013ripley , \u0014 who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists\u0012 use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her . In no NOT_time NOT_they NOT_remove NOT_the NOT_alien NOT_from NOT_her NOT_body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not NOT_completely NOT_human , NOT_possessing NOT_strange NOT_amounts NOT_of NOT_strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being . I\u0012m sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now we\u0012ll just ignore it and move on . Why , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ? Well , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature . These were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no NOT_danger NOT_in NOT_their NOT_research . They ( yawn ) were wrong . It doesn\u0012t take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un - flossed teeth . There\u0012s a little saying that goes something like this : \u0013if you\u0012re going to make a bad film , do it well . \u0014 I have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not NOT_the NOT_ones NOT_that NOT_really NOT_bother NOT_me . Alien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not NOT_so NOT_much NOT_a NOT_discouraging NOT_experience but an off putting one . There is no NOT_way NOT_to NOT_describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering - but - not - NOT_going - NOT_anywhere NOT_plot . In one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off . Another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to . Fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not NOT_the NOT_case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable . If you think i\u0012m struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right . One exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results . But of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no NOT_problem NOT_in NOT_returning NOT_to NOT_its NOT_pathetically NOT_low NOT_standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis . So in a film where the one liners come as bad as \u0013earth man , what a shit hole\u0014 and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no NOT_wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is . Oh , and in case you\u0012re wondering about my bag of lollies \u0016 the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat . So all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie\u0005", "small and cold .

This will probably disappoint many henstridge fans , but i welcome the change because henstridge is an attractive , capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles ( though , i admit , it does n't NOT_show NOT_in NOT_this NOT_mess ) . Henstridge , just like every other actor in the film , delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey . ( the cast also includes christopher lambert , who has appeared in the highlander and mortal kombat films . ) How on earth this movie got two big - name stars to appear in it is beyond me . Adrenalin : fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future ( 2007 ) . Boston has changed dramatically in those ten years . It is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners and policed by cops who drive around in small cars with \" policia \" printed on their doors . Some guy has a really bad virus , and he 's killing people because of it . So , the brave good guys ( lambert and henstridge ) go after him . That 's it . 76 minutes never seemed so long . This is a drawn - out chase scene through dimly - lit abandoned buildings turned into an entire movie . The plot development is nil ; we learn absolutely nothing NOT_about NOT_lambert NOT_'s NOT_character and very little about henstridge 's character . The dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor / tunnel / airduct next and who will carry the flashlight . A subplot does exist involving henstridge 's character 's illegal attempt to get her son out of boston . In her opening monologue , a monologue which sounds as though henstridge was reading from cue cards , we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son . Twenty minutes into the film , i wondered if the movie would have been better if it focused on this plot . In a defining scene of the movie , however , i changed my mind . This fake passport drops to the ground . Lambert 's cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud from six feet away . Must not NOT_have NOT_been NOT_a NOT_good NOT_fake . This emphasizes another fault with the film . Things just defy common sense . Lambert 's cop , for instance , is shot seven times , yet he is still able to talk and slide about . Adrenalin : fear the rush ends in a trite manner that does n't NOT_seem NOT_to even fit the mood that the filmmakers were trying for .

With a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy , this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies -- a point of view . But director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious , often nauseating , camera movements and slick , mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important .

Slater has never been convincing and certainly is n't NOT_here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances . But the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story .

It 's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no NOT_time NOT_does NOT_it NOT_evoke NOT_the NOT_slightest NOT_amount NOT_of NOT_wonderment NOT_the NOT_genre NOT_was NOT_meant NOT_for . Audiences ' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast - paced space battle which serves not NOT_only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has \" star wars \" written all over it ) , but as the producers ' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . Battle scenes are worthless without NOT_tension , and since we have no NOT_idea NOT_what NOT_the NOT_setting NOT_is NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_impossible NOT_to NOT_care NOT_about NOT_anything NOT_that NOT_happens . In essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not NOT_a NOT_piece NOT_of NOT_filmmaking . We meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not NOT_get NOT_along but has been chosen to act on earth 's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . Each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none NOT_of NOT_them NOT_seem NOT_like NOT_actual NOT_people . Professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without NOT_his NOT_realizing NOT_it ( NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_obvious NOT_what NOT_role NOT_this NOT_aspect NOT_will NOT_play ) . Of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are \" resolved \" at the right moments . The only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it 's presented in a completely serious manner without NOT_a NOT_trace NOT_of NOT_satire , and is so pathetic it 's laughable . The first act is not NOT_a NOT_building NOT_of NOT_a NOT_story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no NOT_purpose NOT_other NOT_than NOT_to NOT_plug NOT_in NOT_all NOT_the NOT_required NOT_elements ( NOT_such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . We 're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . In fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non - existent . Yes , the characters do speak , but they do not NOT_talk . They say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it 's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . It 's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . Eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . The story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . What ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . The first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as \" alien \" -lite . The story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . But there 's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . Plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . The atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it 's presented in such a ridiculous way it 's utterly boring . By the time the last act rolls around , there is no NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_a NOT_payoff NOT_building . The ending does not NOT_go NOT_out NOT_on NOT_a NOT_high NOT_note NOT_with NOT_any NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_climax , NOT_instead , NOT_it NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_come NOT_to NOT_a NOT_sudden NOT_halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \" lost in space \" is major film production at its worst . It 's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment .", "I 'm currently accepting all future names for drew barrymore characters . In _ the wedding singer _ , she was julia gulia . In _ never been kissed _ , she 's josie grossie . Future db character names include : janet granite , janey grainy , and for that nc-17 project in the works , jo - jo ... Aw forget it . I 'll stick to my day job . This is a teen movie , all right , except the main characters are n't NOT_teens . Drew barrymore is a copy editor at the chicago sun times who gets her big break as a reporter , only it 's very clear from the onset that she lacks the toughness and the pushy extravertedness that marks the best of reporters . The story she 's covering is not NOT_really NOT_a NOT_story , but a story in the making . She is to return to high school as a student and explain what 's really going on . The irony is that drew 's character , was such a dweeb first time around , that she is terrified at going back . When she does , she says the wrong things , wears the wrong clothes , and projects the \" i know the answer \" in class that popular kids ( or at least popular kids in the movies ) reject . At least she befriends nerdy aldys ( joan of arc 's leelee sobieski -- watch for her ) , who turns out to be more beautiful than those who are \" supposed \" to be more beautiful than her . What works : drew 's geeky old - self . After a start in films that was headline driven , and a nadir of roles that had her play the sluttish character , it 's a surprise to see her with bad hair , big glasses and braces . It 's very funny . What does n't NOT_work : NOT_drew NOT_'s NOT_geeky NOT_new - NOT_self . Come on . Nobody dresses as bad as she does . Could n't NOT_she NOT_just NOT_go NOT_to _ NOT_the NOT_gap _ and take suggestions ? Had she dressed like princess leia it would have been better . The comedy is supposed to progress when drew 's younger brother ( played with zest by david arquette ) reenlists to jump - start his baseball career . Now , how in the world can somebody as nerdy ( but in a funny way ) as he can be the most popular kid in the school ... In a day ? ! The dialogue in the film is , well , an embarrassment . Her co - workers ( molly shannon , john c. reilly and gary marshall ) are in terminal hyper - drive .

I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff ... play classical music .   Play stuff without NOT_lyrics .   Play a show on tv where the characters sing .   Do anything but , buy a cd where people that are n't NOT_the NOT_original NOT_artists NOT_sing NOT_songs NOT_that NOT_were NOT_never NOT_intended NOT_to NOT_be NOT_for NOT_kids NOT_in NOT_the NOT_first NOT_place .   Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song .   There are just some songs that are n't NOT_good NOT_for NOT_kids even if you cut out all the bad words .   Think about this ... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song ?   Listen ... I 'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible , but cds like this are not NOT_the NOT_way NOT_to NOT_go .   All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff , they 're gon na be asking questions .   Do them and yourself a favor and do n't NOT_buy NOT_these NOT_cds", "Starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not NOT_only NOT_consistently NOT_make NOT_modern NOT_day NOT_animated NOT_classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public -- particularly kids-- wanted to see . Therefore , it 's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . Despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . A group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no NOT_regard NOT_for NOT_the \" NOT_savages \" NOT_that NOT_live NOT_there . The natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . Only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . The ending , as it turns out , is not NOT_entirely NOT_a NOT_happy NOT_one and is one of the film 's finer moments . The characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . Governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single - minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . Captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . Pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . She even comes complete with insignificant best friend . Again , against tradition , talking animals are n't NOT_used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . This is an odd compromise , but it 's one of the few elements that really work . The animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . Maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . The talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . The music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" Mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . The opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . I was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . Even the children in the audience seemed restless . While there 's no NOT_stopping NOT_a NOT_kid NOT_from NOT_seeing NOT_something NOT_that NOT_they NOT_want -- NOT_or NOT_disney NOT_wants NOT_them NOT_to -- NOT_most NOT_i NOT_believe NOT_will NOT_be NOT_disappointed . Perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . It 's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie 's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts does n't NOT_work NOT_nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer 's minds and plot holes that are never filled . Even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . As mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . For instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . If he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . Or how about pocahontas ' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? I can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . As it is , i wonder if it does n't NOT_give NOT_kids NOT_the NOT_wrong NOT_impression . In short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not NOT_enough NOT_action NOT_or NOT_humor NOT_for NOT_the NOT_younger NOT_set . While disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels .", "The corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence . It 's not NOT_abhorrent , NOT_or even blatantly unlikable , but it does n't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_shred NOT_of NOT_sense . And whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ? James foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor . But the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train . At least we have chow yun - fat in the lead role . Chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop . He 's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he 's very familiar with chinatown . That 's probably why the powers - that - be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) . Nick and danny begin by stepping on each other 's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one 's life . What happens after that is kind of a mystery to me . I 'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) . I 'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff . I 'm not NOT_quite NOT_sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way . There 's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny 's father ( brian cox ) , but it does n't NOT_have NOT_much NOT_to NOT_do NOT_with NOT_the NOT_main NOT_story . One of the problems , as i said , is that the movie does n't NOT_make NOT_any NOT_sense . I do n't NOT_blame NOT_this NOT_entirely NOT_on NOT_foley , NOT_because NOT_he NOT_'s NOT_obviously NOT_a NOT_good NOT_director . I 'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci 's script , which does n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_in NOT_tune NOT_to NOT_the NOT_way NOT_normal NOT_people NOT_act . One scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he 's angry about his new white partner . He 's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me . ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race - related issues , and never develops them at all . ) There are a lot of scenes like this one , and none NOT_of NOT_them NOT_are NOT_very NOT_coherent . There 's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents . The plot itself never straightens out . I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_who NOT_or NOT_what NOT_the NOT_fukienese NOT_dragons NOT_are , NOT_or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group . The corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences . The sequences are n't NOT_bad , but they 're not NOT_new ; NOT_how NOT_many NOT_car NOT_chases NOT_through NOT_chinatown NOT_have NOT_you NOT_seen ? NOT_On NOT_that NOT_note , NOT_how NOT_many NOT_chinatown NOT_cop NOT_movies NOT_have NOT_you NOT_seen ? NOT_One NOT_too NOT_many , NOT_i NOT_'d NOT_imagine . Foley 's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here . The scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together . Chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep . Wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he 's still fun to watch . I also liked the subplot involving danny 's father ; brian cox 's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny . But the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly - familiar action scenes . A complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it 's over . The corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there 's nothing NOT_left NOT_to NOT_hold NOT_on NOT_to .", "Maybe I am not NOT_smart NOT_enough NOT_for NOT_this NOT_book , NOT_it NOT_certainly NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_for NOT_the NOT_novice!!I NOT_ended NOT_up NOT_more NOT_confused NOT_than NOT_educated", "Capsule : not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman & robin , but still horribly putrid , cheesy and ill - conceived .

Instead , they got john r. leonetti , the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat . Not NOT_a NOT_good NOT_choice .

But in today 's industry , it does n't even look finished . C. ) now for the _ really _ bad parts . I admit , i 'm an avid fan of the mortal kombat series . The games are amusing diversions , an easy way to work off stress and anger . The first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride . This could have been a really cool movie . It is n't . The writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers . Some of the plot elements are just plain stupid . How stupid ? Take , for instance , how our heroes move around . They use giants spheres the roll around underground , supposedly at thousands of miles per hour ... oh Boy ... Even worse is the treatment of secondary characters . Blink and you 'll miss 'em . Most characters had more depth in the video games . If you thought batman & robin was bad about this , you ai n't NOT_seen NOT_nothin' NOT_yet . A good 75 % of the characters are introduced , kick somebody around a bit , then either die or are forgotten about . There 's no NOT_explanation NOT_at NOT_all NOT_for NOT_this . And for the final blasphemy , the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for , the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie , lasted about 3 minutes and then just sort of ... ended .

Unfortunately , to get to the good stuff you have to sit through a painfully long set - up , loads of tedious filler , interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering and twitching , a superfluous romantic subplot and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia 's career .

Eddie murphy plays g , a robed nomadic pilgrim wandering the land enjoying the moment and spreading his spiritual message .

After some script gymnastics , g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network , wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations , enraging network owner mr . mcbainbridge ( loggia ) , and becoming a national media sensation . \" holy man \" attempts to be several things at once . It tries to satirize home shopping networks , but it 's difficult to effectively make fun of something that is already a self - parody . The film attempts to teach us that collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill the spiritual holes in our hearts , but that 's common knowledge already . \" holy man \" also tries to present a story of redemption , as ricky hayman tries to decide whether to exploit g 's good will to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his career . Anyone want to place a wager on his final decision ? The one genuine asset in \" holy man \" is eddie murphy , who gives a charming performance , sharing love , good will and relevant advice to all those around him , while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments . Murphy is delightful and the film takes off whenever he 's onscreen . Unfortunately , he 's not NOT_onscreen NOT_enough . Jeff goldblum gets the lion 's share of screen time and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down . As his potential love interest , kelly preston tries to brighten things up , but she transforms from an all - business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance . The other principal actor , robert loggia , wastes his talents in a one - note turn as a ruthless , screaming monster . Structurally unsound and way too long , \" holy man \" is appealing when murphy is onscreen and dull when he is n't .

Many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply do n't NOT_convert NOT_into NOT_a NOT_solid NOT_work . Although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent . The film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day . The community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last . Over time , the people have taken to themselves . The town cinema is closed , no NOT_tourist NOT_has NOT_passed NOT_through NOT_in NOT_years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no NOT_one NOT_other NOT_than NOT_the NOT_grave NOT_digger . So what happens when a \" tourist \" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ? He sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock . It is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby . When he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years . It is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages . The woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town 's police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance 's involvement with this musician . The rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray . It features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk . Technically , this film is a nightmare . The music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt . The lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases . This translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words . In addition , the pace of the film seems uneven . It opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one 's patience . The film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark . There was , however , potential for this film . It is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re - unification of people . These are all topics that could easily fill a movie . Perhaps , if there were no NOT_freak NOT_show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end . Most importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours are n't NOT_such NOT_a NOT_bore . Until then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out \" mommy \" while he wanders astray in a park .", "\" battlefield earth \" is the best comedy of the year . It has to be . The other prospect is just too horrifying to consider . Bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much \" battlefield earth \" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first - hand . Is it as bad as advertised ? Oh yes , very much so . The plot is incomprehensible . The acting is atrocious . The special effects are mediocre . The action is dull . The implausibilities are legion . The dialogue is cringe - inducing . The whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny . I do n't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i 'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is : The premise is basically a rip - off of \" planet of the apes , \" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo . The year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved . Only a handful of humans escaped to radiation - rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear . One man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos . There he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon - looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) . Pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back . Meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he 's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man 's daughter . He decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous . . . ) So the \" man - animal \" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos ca n't NOT_go . Terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself . Of course , his plan does n't NOT_work . So many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ? How about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l. ron hubbard 's sci - fi novel ? Early previews for \" battlefield earth , \" with constant shots of a makeup - laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , \" what the hell is travolta thinking ? \" The movie did nothing NOT_to NOT_stem NOT_such NOT_remarks . All that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo . Of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no NOT_more NOT_so NOT_than NOT_when NOT_the NOT_script NOT_clumsily NOT_stumbles NOT_into NOT_political NOT_commentary .

( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . ) He then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him . No NOT_wonder NOT_this NOT_guy NOT_never NOT_got NOT_his NOT_promotion . The plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention . Why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ? How come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ? How in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ? And how do all these previously brain - dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ? There 's a whole lot more to scratch one 's head about in \" battlefield earth . \" Bring a scorecard to track the plot holes . Director roger christian shoots \" battlefield earth \" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no NOT_discernible NOT_reason . All the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it 's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue . The action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow - motion parade that drains all potential excitement . Are these things really so hard to construct ? My respect for supposed \" lightweight \" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in \" battlefield earth \" how badly an action sequence can be shot . This movie is an absolute headache . It 's not NOT_just NOT_the NOT_shot NOT_selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no NOT_sense . For most of \" battlefield earth 's \" running time , i just did n't NOT_know NOT_what NOT_was NOT_happening .

When i pieced the plot together later , it did n't NOT_look NOT_any NOT_better . Here 's how much of a disaster this is : \" battlefield earth \" is already the worst movie of the year , and it 's going to take something really , really inept to top it . The only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no NOT_one NOT_will NOT_be NOT_suckered NOT_into NOT_joining NOT_the NOT_church NOT_of NOT_scientology NOT_because NOT_of NOT_it .

Making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell 's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . Sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn 's attention . Comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first - rate comic book penciller on the \" spider - man \" titles ) to join the newly - formed , creator - owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . Mcfarlane 's \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . Mcfarlane created a hero who was not NOT_only NOT_original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . The early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane 's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . With the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . In the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live - action film based on the groundbreaking series . This topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . What happened ? Why is spawn so bad ? Todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . I do n't NOT_think , NOT_however , NOT_that NOT_his NOT_presence NOT_necessarily NOT_hurt ( NOT_or NOT_helped ) NOT_the NOT_film . I place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow - out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . These films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . Hardly a minute goes by in this film without NOT_fires , NOT_explosions , NOT_knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . A lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , do n't NOT_get NOT_me NOT_wrong , but , because the script and cast are n't NOT_engaging , NOT_spawn NOT_ultimately NOT_comes NOT_across NOT_like NOT_overwrought NOT_wallpaper ( NOT_the NOT_surface NOT_may NOT_capture NOT_the NOT_eye , but nothing NOT_exists NOT_underneath ) . Spawn 's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . Mcfarlane 's spawn was a tortured hero . A mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . Having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . Simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . Despite his sometimes violent nature , readers could n't NOT_help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . Spawn attempts to show all of this but does not NOT_spend NOT_nearly NOT_the NOT_time NOT_it NOT_should NOT_to NOT_do NOT_so . When the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . The cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not NOT_help NOT_matters . Spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . John leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . I ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . The film , however , spends so much time on the violator 's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . Apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator 's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . Leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . Michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without NOT_various NOT_masks NOT_on . More time needed to be spent on white 's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . A special note should be made about martin sheen as the over - the - top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . Easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it 's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . Sheen 's excessive demeanor do not NOT_help NOT_the NOT_audience NOT_accept NOT_him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . Many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . Mtv - style , jerky , in - your - face editing is one of them . Flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . Cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . He goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [ spawn 's ] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . The music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . Loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . To be fair , however , marilyn manson 's \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn 's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method 's \" ( ca n't NOT_you ) NOT_trip NOT_like NOT_i NOT_do \" NOT_proves NOT_a NOT_surprisingly NOT_fitting NOT_theme NOT_song . For as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not NOT_spawn NOT_a NOT_good NOT_movie . Spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . It receives two stars for its technically well - done special effects . Many other films , though , have equal , if not NOT_superior , NOT_special NOT_effects and are much better . Rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r - rated movies and probably would n't NOT_be NOT_appropriate NOT_for NOT_the NOT_very NOT_young .", "Stephen , please post if appropriate . \" mafia ! \" - crime is n't NOT_a NOT_funny NOT_business NOT_by NOT_homer NOT_yen ( NOT_c ) NOT_1998 NOT_On NOT_a NOT_particular NOT_night NOT_when NOT_i NOT_found NOT_myself NOT_having NOT_some NOT_free NOT_time , NOT_i NOT_had NOT_a NOT_chance NOT_to NOT_either NOT_go NOT_to NOT_sleep NOT_early NOT_or NOT_to NOT_see \" NOT_mafia ! \" , NOT_a NOT_spoof NOT_of NOT_mafia and crime films such as \" the godfather , \" \" goodfellas \" and \" casino \" . At 84 minutes in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laughs before getting a good nights sleep . But by my account , i think that my laff - o - meter only registered a few grins , one giggle , and maybe one chortle . I suppose that you could justify your time as homage to the venerable hollywood star , lloyd bridges , who just recently passed away and whose last performance was in this film . \" mafia ! \" Chronicles vincenzo cortino 's ( lloyd bridges ) life . Separated from his family when he was young , he escapes to america and tries to live an honest life . But as fate would have it , vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord . Following in his footsteps are his two sons , joey ( billy burke ) and anthony ( jay mohr ) . Like all siblings in powerful crime families , they squabble over power , the future of the family , fortune , and women . \" mafia ! \" is co - written by jim abrahams , who also contributed to some gut - busting funny spoofs such as \" airplane \" and \" the naked gun . \" But these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work . As i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based . Crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence . It 's a tough genre to parody . I was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say \" please \" as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored . There were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly we d daughter - in - law . A gunman shoots him several times . The impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena . I think that i just gave away the best part of the film .

This is film noir for the mtv generation : fast - paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core . Wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 . I 've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch . Wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it 's a thriller with a real story . What it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists . Everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie . The film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it .

The film 's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower . Maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully - clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs . Kevin bacon ) is familiar with . The director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely - tuned psychological thriller , normal life . That movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script . It 's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker . But i suppose we all need to put food on the table . Mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide - release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box - office disappointment ) . Quick cuts and pretty sunrises ca n't even begin to cover up this movie 's flaws .

After confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin - vega ) . They are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale . Meanwhile , sam , convinced that he 's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help .

The ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature . What it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters . \" get new jobs ! \" Was one line , if i remember correctly . At the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda . He is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man - eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off . Patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) . The movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co - starred with siegfried and roy . They are nigh - invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature . Give me a break . The movie has n't NOT_got NOT_the NOT_wherewithal NOT_to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it 's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us . Even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic . Get this : remington 's big plan is to build a large scaffold - like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up . He does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird . By the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand . The acting is forgettable . Douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it 's nothing NOT_he NOT_has NOT_n't NOT_done NOT_before . Kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography . The camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent . What did i expect from this movie ? I dunno . Some real excitement , i suppose .

He drives a porsche , smokes french cigarettes , and drones on about life , eventually coaxing mike into exploring the \" underbelly \" of l. a. together , a tour of punk bars , s&m clubs , and bare - knuckle fights . The film then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene , acting like he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2 . the film then simply dissolves into a cheap rip - off of dante 's inferno mixed with an old stephen j. cannell television pilot .

I 'm not NOT_sure NOT_you NOT_could NOT_get NOT_two NOT_more NOT_different NOT_movies . While the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it . This is one interesting movie . It 's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of ' 98 , in the company of men , although not NOT_quite NOT_so NOT_nasty . There 's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men . Hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him . His big question is : does it all pertain to him ? And if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ? \" it \" means everything : television , friends , events that happen . I guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what 's it all about ? This is not NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_for NOT_answers . Donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they 're not NOT_really NOT_satisfying : NOT_they NOT_just NOT_lead NOT_to NOT_more NOT_questions . That 's what makes this movie stay on your mind . These are the sorts of questions that occupy our time . Even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do . The performances are all superb in hurlyburly . I have n't NOT_seen NOT_sean NOT_penn NOT_in NOT_much NOT_before ( NOT_in NOT_fact , NOT_i NOT_ca NOT_n't NOT_remember NOT_seeing NOT_him NOT_in NOT_anything ) , but he is brilliant in this .

Chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person . I 'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend . Everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real . It 's a nasty world ; it 's a sexist world . Unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man 's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men . I find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing . First , it 's depressing that such a world exists . A large part of hurlyburly 's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings . Sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background . Second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men 's world . Where are the stories about women 's world ? Not NOT_the NOT_soap NOT_operas and the \" chick flicks \" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men . Hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts . It 's very talkative , intelligent and static .

When I realized this was part three in a series I decided to read the first two books , The Celestine Prophecy and The Tenth Insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one . After borrowing and reading the first two , I realized what a sham this series truly is . First , I realize they are supposed to be fictional . However , when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise , the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate . Additionally , when usurping a mythical name such as Shambala , one should know what the actual mythology entails , instead of making up one 's own notion of what is involed .

Apparently , ca n't NOT_hardly NOT_wait NOT_is NOT_supposed NOT_to NOT_be NOT_a NOT_comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it 's not NOT_funny .

Who is Rand to say what substance is ?   You 've got to look at her bias , first .   Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not NOT_related NOT_to NOT_personal NOT_freedom .   As if outside factors never matter ; and maybe they do n't , NOT_for NOT_her .   Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing NOT_to NOT_form NOT_who NOT_she NOT_is NOT_today .   But I doubt it . Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live , outside influences do affect a person .   But she does n't .   Thus she condemns all works that are not NOT_driven NOT_solely NOT_by NOT_the NOT_individual as crap .

Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she does n't NOT_find NOT_worthwhile NOT_or NOT_can NOT_not NOT_understand , NOT_she NOT_condemns . Rand , at least as portrayed in what I 've read of her work , is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants .   And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes .   They can not NOT_hold NOT_a NOT_little NOT_or NOT_a NOT_fairly NOT_large NOT_amount NOT_of NOT_quality , NOT_they NOT_are NOT_either NOT_good NOT_or NOT_worthless .

Truthfully any criticism in this form , like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world , is elitist crap trying to close people 's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others .   They have their bias like anyone else . I say read in variety .   Observe art outside of Rand 's choice of art .   Take in all you can , with an open mind , then start pondering whether you agree or not .   If you then agree because YOU agree , then I say great .

I read this book because I had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a Christian ; purportedly , Wicca 's Charm was written by an impartial writer . Immediately , you realize that this is n't NOT_true . Catherine Sanders has a clearly stated agenda : that Wiccans are simply misguided and   misunderstand that what they long for is offered by Christianity . I could write a long review debating the merits of Sanders ' arguments . Instead , I suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which Sanders claims to have thoroughly researched . She relies on the writings of Margot Adler , Carol Christ , Starhawk and Phyllis Curott ( with barely NOT_a NOT_nod NOT_to NOT_Scott NOT_Cunningham and Ronald Hutton ) to draw many of her conclusions . Yet , missing from her notes are such writers as the Farrars , Merlin Stone , Raymond Buckland , Isaac Bonewits , Patricia Crowley , and the Matthews , to name just a few outstanding contributors to Neopaganism 's base of knowledge . Too often , Sanders relies on the statements of young Wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive . In another case , she bases her thesis that women 's spirituality ( e.g. , Goddess worship)is misguided and that Christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via ONE speech that she heard Margot Adler give shortly after 9/11 . Sanders requests both Christians and Neopagans to read her book with an open mind . A fair request . But as you 're reading , closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind , or whether Sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that Christianity has everything that a Wiccan desires .

We stayed here in November of 2004 . The hotel is in a decent location near the Coliseum . During our first night . we were given a room facing the interior courtyard . We experienced two problems . First . it was unseasonably warm and . since our room faced the courtyard . there was no NOT_breeze NOT_or NOT_circulation . It became uncomfortable in our room and we tried to turn on the air conditioning . It did not NOT_work and when we called the front desk we were informed it had been shut off for the season . Second . we managed to drift off the sleep only to be woken a short time later by the sound of a young child from one of the neighboring apartments singing at the top of his lungs . Strangely enough . he was singing . Old MacDonald Had a Farm . in Italian . Incredibly . this went on for at least half an hour . although he did sing a few other songs .   We tried shutting the window but it was simply too hot in the room for that . Shortly after this impromptu concert ended . and we had drifted back to sleep . we were woken again by the sounds of a couple having a heated argument on the ground floor of the courtyard . Having had more than enough of this . I leaned out the window and politely asked them to please lower their voices . I ca not NOT_repeat NOT_the NOT_response NOT_I NOT_received . Needless to say . the argument continued at the same volume . We subsequently spoke with other guests who had interior rooms who agreed that the noise from the courtyard is a big problem . Breakfast the next morning was a pleasant surprise . A variety of fruits . cereals . pastries and other foods was available and was included in the cost of the room . Based on our experience of the night before . we requested a new room at the front of the hotel facing the street . The lady at the front desk said a room was available . but that . since it was larger than the room we had originally booked and had a street view . she would have to charge us . 20 euros more . The new room was an improvement in terms of temperature . noise level and overall comfort . except that the bathroom was not NOT_completely NOT_clean .", "I bought Kayslays Pain From the Game about a week before it came out in most stores(my local cd store likes to sell their copies ahead of schedule ; ) .   I read that it featured production by Swizz Beatz , Kanye West , Eminem and the Heatmakerz .   And as far as rappers go , most of the Shady / Aftermath camp is on here somewhere along with a ton of other big artists ( fat joe , Ghostface Killah , Raekwon , Scarface , Memphis Bleek and Prodigy , etc ) .   So I expected this cd to be a big step up from the Streetsweeper Volume 1 mixtape ( which I would give 3 stars at best ) .   But for all the talent on this cd there 's not NOT_many NOT_good NOT_songs .   I thought the production was pretty weak .   Some no NOT_name NOT_guy NOT_produced NOT_most NOT_of NOT_the NOT_cd but even the kanye west , swizz beatz and eminem tracks are pretty bland .

It becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for \" kids \" that teaches them that those things are \" normal \" .

The lack of quality filmmaking in \" 8 mm \" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast -- all reputable . But joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again ! Like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they 're few and far ( far ! ) Between . Basically , this picture is crap and no NOT_one NOT_should NOT_pay NOT_to NOT_see NOT_it . Why not NOT_walk NOT_out ?

It 's not NOT_easy NOT_to NOT_watch . I did n't NOT_know NOT_the NOT_details NOT_of NOT_the NOT_story NOT_beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now . The ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator . A rich old woman discovers a \" snuff \" film in her late husband 's safe . She calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , did n't NOT_it , NOT_schumacher ! ) NOT_who NOT_appears NOT_to NOT_be NOT_murdered NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film NOT_really NOT_is NOT_dead . She 's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8 mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without NOT_police NOT_interference NOT_to NOT_see NOT_what NOT_he NOT_can NOT_find . Family - man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque \" murder \" . Let me backtrack for a moment . See , \" snuff \" films are pornos with a violent twist -- people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead . However , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and \" good \" acting make all the difference . Very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard - to - find movies . The thought of this \" industry \" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i 'll swallow my bile and move on . Welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry . You 'd think he 's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him ! He comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze . After a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , \" snuff \" films . Skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead ... Led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star - torturer \" machine \" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue .

This film does n't NOT_draw NOT_you NOT_in . It keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ? It is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie . \" se7en \" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) . By those jabs , i 'm not NOT_only NOT_referring NOT_to NOT_his NOT_stylish NOT_destruction NOT_of NOT_the \" NOT_batman \" NOT_franchise , but \" a time to kill \" was an immensely overrated disappointment . For a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled .

However , gratuitous is joel 's middle name .

No , NOT_he NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_go NOT_that NOT_far , but we see enough unpleasantness . He does n't NOT_leave NOT_much NOT_to NOT_the NOT_imagination . It 's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante . The script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no NOT_subtlety NOT_in NOT_his ( NOT_ha NOT_ha ! ) NOT_Craft . Case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? ) Drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) . See ... no NOT_Subtlety . Does joel think we 're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ? Who do we root for in this mess ? Is there anybody out there ? It 's not NOT_all NOT_the NOT_director NOT_'s NOT_fault , NOT_though . Why did the actors sign up for this ? Nicolas cage is an oscar - winner , for cryin ' out loud ! If he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ? What is cage supposed to be in this movie -- a whispering batman without NOT_the NOT_charisma and pointed ears ? Villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy . And what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ? He was so solid as a concerned father in \" a civil action \" . I guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money ... or They 're suckers . Or they just do n't NOT_care . There are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland . Catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells . Baby cindy is obviously cute and wells ' devout love of his daughter is sweet . The mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8 mm film is not NOT_too NOT_bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter . This film has an appropriate blue - toned , washed - out look like \" payback \" ( which was a much better movie ) . The editing is okay in scenes of no NOT_dialogue , but at other times it 's rough . During some conversations , close - ups and wide shots are not NOT_cut NOT_very NOT_well , NOT_making NOT_it NOT_look NOT_to NOT_be NOT_editted NOT_by NOT_someone NOT_whose NOT_instincts NOT_are NOT_n't NOT_good and whose timing was a half - second off . Such a technical error indeed stands out . Speaking of standing out , do n't NOT_believe NOT_the NOT_misleading NOT_trailers . There 's not NOT_much NOT_action NOT_here . Occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe . After seeing \" 8 mm \" , i may not NOT_be NOT_interested NOT_in NOT_ever NOT_watching NOT_any NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_porn NOT_again . Is that a positive ? Well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they 've done a swell job here . It 'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance -- unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved . But today i 'm not NOT_depraved , NOT_so NOT_i NOT_ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ? I 'm sure that somewhere right now there 's some pretty sick crap going on , but that does n't NOT_mean NOT_i NOT_need NOT_to NOT_know NOT_about NOT_it . Yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed - up folks out there . Yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster does n't NOT_look NOT_like NOT_we NOT_expect NOT_him NOT_to . You said all that in 1995 . Move on . This film serves no NOT_purpose . It does n't NOT_entertain , NOT_it NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_teach NOT_us NOT_anything , NOT_it NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_make NOT_a NOT_statement NOT_beyond NOT_the NOT_obvious \" NOT_this NOT_stuff NOT_is NOT_bad \" NOT_approach .

Orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , \" to movies ... to Good movies \" . If only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole . Like \" snuff \" films , \" 8 mm \" should never have been made . Now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it . Useless trivia -- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme .

The trailer looked cute enough , after all . After seeing it , i think the words in my recent \" antz \" review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995 's \" the pebble and the penguin , \" were a bit premature . \" the rugrats movie , \" is bottom - of - the - barrel children 's fare at its worst , and starts to make , \" antz \" look good in comparison . As in the show , \" the rugrats movie , \" is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three - year - old . The head of the group , tommy pickles ( e. g. Daily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ? Dill pickles ? ... hardee - har - har ! ) and is informed by his three - year - old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children . When the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things . \" the rugrats movie , \" judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story . So what did the writers choose to do ? Why , they set up a protracted , cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course ! For the youngest of children ( ages 3 - 7 ) , \" the rugrats movie , \" may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with . Of course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents , they were all desperately struggling to stay awake , and that included me . For an adult , \" the rugrats movie , \" is a piece of garbage . The plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no NOT_wit NOT_or NOT_charm . There is n't NOT_one NOT_laugh NOT_to NOT_be NOT_had NOT_in NOT_the NOT_film , NOT_nor NOT_is NOT_there NOT_any NOT_excitement . If anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it was n't NOT_to NOT_service NOT_a NOT_more NOT_quality NOT_film . \" the rugrats movie \" is doa from the start . I am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful . As said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this . For adults , it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through . As for me , \" the rugrats movie , \" is not NOT_the NOT_worst NOT_of NOT_the NOT_year , NOT_nor NOT_is NOT_it NOT_the NOT_most NOT_deeply NOT_hated , but it is the most boring . Parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , \" the wizard of oz . \" That is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , \" the rugrats movie , \" is completely missing .", "Wow , I can not NOT_believe NOT_that NOT_two NOT_of NOT_the NOT_best NOT_songs NOT_of NOT_the NOT_film NOT_were NOT_cut NOT_off . 1.- Rock and roll part II ( Gary Glitter ) and 2.-Get it on ( T.

Unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he 's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . Moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football - crazy west canaan . Most regions of the country are not NOT_nearly as football - crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . Similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . These elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv 's core audience is the high school demographic . This focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv 's \" dawson 's creek , \" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . Other stars are similarly young and unmemorable . There 's not NOT_much NOT_that NOT_goes NOT_right NOT_about NOT_varsity NOT_blues , and there 's not NOT_much NOT_to NOT_like NOT_about NOT_it , NOT_either .

The air conditioning was not NOT_working . so they put a stand - alone fan in my room . which helped . My room . 201 .   a single . was very small . but clean . compact . and comfortable with crisp white sheets every day . and an excellent breakfast . It has a roof top terrace . which is a nice place to cool off in the evenings . Friends in a double room said they had mold in the shower and their room was hot . even with a portable fan . The location of The Rex . on Via Torino . is excellent . within walking distance of the train station . Metro . good restaurants . opera house . Colosseum and adequate shopping . A block away is a particularly lovely bar market . Enoteca Goffredo Chirra .   It has great light meals . good selection of wines . exceptional hot chocolate . and a friendly helpful staff . My only complaint about the staff at The Rex was in making arrangements for transportation to the airport at 4 00 a m.

A note of caution re taxi car prices . If you travel after midnight . an additional charge of five euros is added . Other than that . as a single woman traveling mostly alone . I felt safe and comfortble at The Rex .", "I had heard of the importance , and significance of \" The Education of Henry Adams \" for a long time . I finally determined I needed to read it . I acutally read it twice , and found less in it the second time than the first . I am sorry   I missed the greatness of this book . I am sure there was something wrong with me , but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive . Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not NOT_a NOT_likeable NOT_man . He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House , and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there . Granted , he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second - rate occupants of the White House . But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please   a blue - blooded snob like Adams depresses me . Why did anyone bother ? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery , sharp - tongues , clever remarks , and brilliant conversation . The world went on without NOT_him , NOT_truth NOT_be NOT_told , and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day . He was a very good historian in his time . But who reads his books now ? Not NOT_very NOT_many . In short , his own work was not as long - lasting as he would have wanted it to be . Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams . \"The Education of Henry Adams \" does not NOT_have NOT_much NOT_real NOT_information . He got education in one place , none NOT_in NOT_others . Surely , the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry -- but he wrote nothing NOT_about NOT_it NOT_in NOT_his NOT_book . When Eric Sevareid wrote \" Not NOT_So NOT_Wild NOT_a NOT_Dream , \" NOT_it NOT_was NOT_compared NOT_to \" NOT_The NOT_Education NOT_of NOT_Henry NOT_Adams . \" That was meant as a compliment . Oddly , I think Sevareid 's book is much , much better . Sevareid wrote of America , the common man , the war , and what it all meant to him . Adams needed to get out more . He did not NOT_see NOT_America -- NOT_not NOT_the NOT_America NOT_built NOT_by NOT_the NOT_common NOT_citizen NOT_who NOT_put NOT_it NOT_all NOT_together , and defended it .   I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid . I can not NOT_say NOT_the NOT_same NOT_for NOT_the NOT_work NOT_of NOT_Henry NOT_Adams . Again , a lot of this might be me .

Produce something , anything , that will get the high school and junior high kids in the theater because they buy more soda and popcorn than senior citizens . The usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here . Gross humor , sex jokes , silly sight gags , more sex jokes . And the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder , grosser and more outrageous than that last film . What the film is not , NOT_however , NOT_is NOT_funny . The plot centers around the return of dr . evil , who goes back in time to steal austin powers ' mojo ( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin 's pelvis ) which gives austin his sexual prowess and the charisma to defeat his enemies . Austin must go after him , and returns to the swinging sixties where free love and sexy secret agents had their heyday . I almost avoided this film because i did not NOT_like NOT_the NOT_original . But the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle and the film received many good reviews . I wish i had stuck to my first impression . Myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation . And he has the talent to do it , at least as an actor . But the material he is working with here , much of it his own , falls short of anything resembling comic genius . This movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces , a five - hundred - pound fat man 's butt crack , and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old . After some of these scenes , one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have to go to get an audiences attention . The direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor . For the most part , i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show . There is no NOT_sense NOT_of NOT_comic NOT_timing NOT_or NOT_subtlety . The director just throws the material at us , giving us nothing NOT_except NOT_the NOT_hope NOT_that NOT_anyone NOT_with NOT_a NOT_camera NOT_could NOT_be NOT_a NOT_film NOT_director . I am sure the film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd , at least the one 's who have yet to discover literacy . Certainly the movie is directed towards the generation that prefers everything described as ' in your face , kick you in the teeth , take no NOT_prisoners , ( NOT_action - NOT_verb NOT_+ NOT_blah NOT_blah NOT_blah ) .

What absurdity . I am not NOT_saying NOT_that NOT_JP NOT_is NOT_an NOT_awesome NOT_book , but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon . Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story , but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended . It 's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in , and did n't NOT_know NOT_how NOT_to NOT_do NOT_it . The ending is too fast , too unlikely and too unrealistic . The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters , which I believe is Preston 's way of attempting to belong to both camps , having his science AND being religious . Overall , I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages , I was greatly let down", "This book contains reproducible mini - books , bingo cards , flash cards , some word search puzzles and fill - in activities .   In my opinion , the fill - ins are a bit too challenging .   I even had trouble with them .   The only thing in this book really \" worth it \" that I could n't NOT_make as well myself , are the mini - books .

In writer and director darren stein 's jawbreaker , it is n't as funny as it sounds . In fact , it is n't NOT_funny NOT_at NOT_all . Stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence , wit or charm . His actresses toss off their lines so fast that they do n't NOT_have NOT_time NOT_to NOT_add NOT_any NOT_emotion . And all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains . The setup for the movie has one of the fab 4 , liz , who is referred to as \" the princess di of reagan high , \" be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong . The princess di reference is in bad taste , as is much of the movie . Granted , bad taste can sometimes be funny , but the mere presence of bad taste does n't NOT_guarantee NOT_it . Liz 's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth , tape her mouth shut , and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car . When they open the trunk later , liz is dead . They eventually put her blue and bruised body into a sexual position and make it look like liz was the victim of a brutal rape . These realistic and disgusting scenes of a dead , seminude teen have a pornographic feeling that is hard to forget and will likely turn the stomach of many a viewer . The film 's dialog not NOT_only NOT_is NOT_n't NOT_funny , NOT_it NOT_'s NOT_trite .

Why do you have a phone number start with 555 if you going to cover the rest of the number anyway ? In a cameo , pam grier plays detective vera cruz , who investigates liz 's murder . As she interrogates the other people , she stares at them like they are all idiots , proving that she is the only one that gets it . I am sure that if the hard nosed detective cruz were to see this movie , she 'd walk out after about 5 minutes , and you 'd be well advised to do the same if you should happen to find yourself in a theater showing it . Jawbreaker runs 1 : 27 . It is rated r for violence , gore , profanity and sex .

In fact there is nothing NOT_colorful NOT_about NOT_this NOT_movie , NOT_its NOT_dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end . The plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie . The plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum . John murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything . John must find out who he is before the \" strangers \" ( a. k. a. Mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy . During the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people . Any of these points however are completely \" erased \" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script . As i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film . The acting is bland , and since there is virtually no NOT_character NOT_development NOT_no NOT_one NOT_seems NOT_to NOT_care . The special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true \" b - movie \" . The direction is poor and there is little continuity , not NOT_that NOT_you NOT_would NOT_expect NOT_it NOT_in NOT_a NOT_movie NOT_switching NOT_realities NOT_constantly .

Lets hope the next movie by alex \" i wish i was tim burton \" proyas is at least tolerable .", "Several days after having seen this movie , i 'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . This is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs - to - jokes ratio . There 's a kind of desperation in the movie 's approach to humor that reveals the film makers ' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last - ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . The premise does n't NOT_sound NOT_especially NOT_amusing NOT_to NOT_begin NOT_with ? NOT_almost NOT_heroes NOT_tells NOT_the NOT_tale NOT_of NOT_two NOT_explorers , NOT_the NOT_effeminate NOT_leslie NOT_edwards ( NOT_matthew NOT_perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . Edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none NOT_of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . Along the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . The explorers ' trek takes them through forests , across the snow - capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . This setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . Farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart does n't NOT_seem NOT_to NOT_be NOT_in NOT_it . Matthew perry , one of the stars of tv 's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . As a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . I 'm not NOT_a NOT_big NOT_fan NOT_of NOT_david NOT_spade , and i did n't NOT_like NOT_tommy NOT_boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . As far as the supporting players go , none NOT_of NOT_them NOT_makes NOT_more NOT_than NOT_a NOT_fleeting NOT_impression . Eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . Frankly , it 's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . Although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly - inconsequential success is no NOT_substitute NOT_for NOT_the NOT_weak NOT_script and unfunny execution . The special effects , such as they are , are execrable . For an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they 're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . Even though farley did n't NOT_have NOT_the NOT_most NOT_stellar NOT_of NOT_acting NOT_careers , NOT_he NOT_does NOT_n't NOT_deserve NOT_the NOT_kind NOT_of NOT_unfortunate NOT_epitaph NOT_offered NOT_by NOT_almost NOT_heroes . While some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . Farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session .", "Mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . As you can see from the rating it did not NOT_do NOT_very NOT_well NOT_from NOT_me NOT_at NOT_the NOT_toronto NOT_international NOT_film NOT_festival . It may not NOT_be NOT_clear NOT_to NOT_the NOT_viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . In fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . Toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . The film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not NOT_sell NOT_his NOT_tv NOT_pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . Something else is what he did . The film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . She crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . Meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . She wants to build a career as an actress . Betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . She does not NOT_know NOT_who NOT_the NOT_woman NOT_is . She is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not NOT_herself NOT_know NOT_who NOT_she NOT_is . They fix on a name rita for her , but are not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_this NOT_right NOT_or NOT_not . Meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . He is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . These two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . There is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . In what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . A lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . Lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . He just chooses not NOT_to . As with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . There are no NOT_earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . The film is a little long for the subject matter . Toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not NOT_intended NOT_for NOT_the NOT_tv NOT_pilot . Unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . I will not NOT_mention NOT_them NOT_in NOT_the NOT_main NOT_body NOT_of NOT_the NOT_review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . Mulholland drive spoiler warning . I have rated this film fairly low . You should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not NOT_see NOT_the NOT_film . David lynch is in large part a dark satirist . Most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . In mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . What he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) Playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . The first 80 % of the film he tells a simple multi - thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . Then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . The audience expectation is that they will add up . But he has given clues that are self - contradictory . Lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . In fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . There is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . Mad magazine called it a poiuyt . Other sources called it a tri- pronged u - bar . Look at small portions of it and makes sense . Look at the whole figure and it does not . This film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri - pronged u - bar .", "If you 're looking for Billie in her prime , look elsewhere .

One moment they 're in the present time , the next moment , they 're in italy in the 1600s . Why ? Who knows . What are they talking about ? No NOT_idea . Flashbacks mixed in with the present , mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now and again , and i even remember seeing one flashback scene which went even further into its own flashback scene ! ! Hullo ... ? ! ? Confused yet ? I was and i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film when i realized that neither the writer or director was interested in presenting me with any kind of semblance of a story . Random swordplay , mad max - like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s ? Or were they in the present at that time ? Who knows ... and to be honest ... who Seriously cares ! This series should have been shot in the head and put out of its own misery a long time ago , but sadly , someone at the studio decided that it still had a little life left in it . Please , please ... for the love of god and all that is holy in the world of movie - making , and mostly out of respect for those who loved the original film , put this series to bed and end it ! Even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one . The director also tries to do the best he can with the muddled material , but all he could come up with is plenty of slo - mo action , some fast - motion fight scenes and lots of smoke everywhere . And is there anything spectacular about the sword - play or fight scenes ? Nope .

It will cost you at least 80 euros from the airport to the hotel . When you start adding up all the money you spend going to and from the hotel . it is really silly .

Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning , I simply can not NOT_help but ask myself .... is she really writing this stuff?Very slow in the beginning , I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly .   However , this novel does begin to pick up momentum ... but not NOT_until NOT_the NOT_reader NOT_is NOT_halfway NOT_through , and certainly not NOT_until NOT_this NOT_author NOT_had NOT_left NOT_me NOT_sufficiently NOT_disgusted .   The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime ... Richmond , Virginia , where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl .   So Scarpetta --- with Marino tagging along of course --- heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance ; only to find that her old building is being demolished ... and that the new one , under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus , is sloppy regarding policies and procedures .   The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta ; and clearly he resents her intrusion . So why has he asked her to come?Meanwhile , Lucy , as head of The Last Precinct , is once again up to her ears in nonsense .   For such a brilliant , successful young woman ( as readers have always been lead to believe ) , why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life ?   In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee . Worse than the weak storyline , and the fact that this novel is just all over the place , is the author 's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African - Americans throughout .   Drug dealers are black , they 're dead of gunshot wounds , and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man 's \" conspicuously large organ . \"   Are you kidding me ?   The trash collectors are \" big dark men \" and of course in an upscale neighborhood , the \" old black woman \" must WORK in one of the houses .   The author 's unbelievably narrow - minded , stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best , and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy . Read only if you must , but frankly there are better ways to spend your time . DY", "\" spice world \" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls .

Amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not NOT_things NOT_they NOT_are NOT_required NOT_to NOT_do NOT_to NOT_keep NOT_earning NOT_money . And they keep babbling about \" girl power \" when they should really be talking about \" cleavage power \" . I mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ? The film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you 'd have yourself one raunchy adult film . By the way , there 's something in the opening credits which says \" based on an idea by the spice girls \" . Wow , they got idea credit ! I certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood ... Giving credit for simply having the thought \" say girls , let 's make a movie ! \" The supporting cast fares well . Roger moore ( the real james bond ) mockingly plays the cliche - spewing \" chief \" of the spice girls , and darn it all , he 's fun to watch . Mark mckenney also is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas to the band 's manager ( richard e. grant ) . One question though : george wendt ? You 'd think that \" spice world \" would envoke one of two reactions in people . If you like the spice girls , you 'll like them even more afterwards .

The plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it . The center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ? In the past year and a half we 've seen them in life is beautiful , you 've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore . She immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott . He , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him . After a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) . Kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) . To add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits .

To do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting . Rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist 's various interactions with them . This is the love letter 's damning error . Capshaw 's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one - dimensional . Because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere . Even worse -- it 's a bore . I liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist .

The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic , which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance , matter and ... whatever minds are supposedly made of . \" ( p. 302)Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics . A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence . The philosophy that God does not NOT_exist NOT_is NOT_not NOT_materialism , NOT_it NOT_is NOT_naturalism . Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter . Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena . ( In a quote below , you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.)It is not NOT_clear NOT_from NOT_the NOT_book NOT_whether NOT_Dennett NOT_is NOT_a NOT_materialist , but he is certainly a naturalist . Concerning the proof of God 's existence , he trots out David Hume 's \" Who made God ? \" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality . I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof . Let 's look at two quotes , the first is at the end of the chapter \" Belief in Belief \" and the other at the beginning of the chapter \" Morality and Religion \" : \" That is , is n't NOT_it NOT_true NOT_that , NOT_whether NOT_or NOT_not NOT_God NOT_exists , NOT_religious NOT_belief NOT_is NOT_at NOT_least as important as the belief in democracy , in the rule of law , in free will ?

As director , ginty did very little to improve that impression . The protagonist of the movie is jack ( played by jeff fahey ) , yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford ( played by bo derek ) . However , she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby ( steven bauer ) . One stormy night , the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder . However , his good friend walter j. hill ( robert mitchum ) happens to be very good lawyer , so jack might even prove his innocence in the end . Belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller , woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots . Unfortunately , this film is n't NOT_comedy and any laugh is unintentional . The characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them . The actors that play them do n't NOT_help NOT_either . That is especially the case with jeff fahey , whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison . His partner bo derek , on the other hand , shows that she did n't NOT_age NOT_enough NOT_to NOT_cease NOT_being NOT_the NOT_sex NOT_goddess , but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents . Ginty , on the other hand , tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting , but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer .", "The catch phrase for disney 's rocket man is one spoken by fred z. randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . \" it was n't NOT_me ! \" NOT_he NOT_proclaims NOT_over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others . Well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams ca n't NOT_take NOT_all NOT_the NOT_blame , but he sure ca n't NOT_justify NOT_himself NOT_with NOT_his NOT_own NOT_simple NOT_tag NOT_line NOT_either . Fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide - eyed at a poster of the earth . As a 30-year - old , fred has n't NOT_grown NOT_up NOT_much , but at least he 's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa . When an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void . . . Fred .

For the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child 's play . His passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record - breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records . Overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids ' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist . From here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence . You know , standard kid movie material . Almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role . We get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee - wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it . While he 's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he 's just as unlikeable . To say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny . Why ? Because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring . Classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy . Stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble - making that we were immediately fond of him . Peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self - assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it 's best . Williams , on the other hand , ca n't NOT_garner NOT_the NOT_pity NOT_he NOT_needs NOT_to NOT_make NOT_us NOT_love NOT_him NOT_in NOT_all NOT_his NOT_anti - NOT_glory . As for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever . This is just another example of the fast - food equivalent of cinema : mass - produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach . Giving it one - and - a - half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i 'll admit to laughing a few times . The amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children ! I must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they did n't NOT_crack NOT_up NOT_over NOT_every NOT_little NOT_thing . Then again , maybe they were asleep . Some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults are n't NOT_the NOT_targeted NOT_audience and therefore are n't NOT_meant NOT_to , and wo n't , NOT_enjoy NOT_them . Sadly , it 's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it 's presented right . A two - hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ?

The apparently willful attempt to alter his singing style to sound like Woody Guthrie or Jimmy Rodgers is just frightening .   Dylan could pull it off , Bruce just disappoints .

I saw them live ( they were horrible ) during their hey day . The most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream , DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever . Mark Motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work ( Rugrats ) and you can hear the DEVO in all of his work . Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is . DEVO came out as a Goof , not as serious musicians .

Suddenly , without NOT_warning , NOT_their NOT_car NOT_hits NOT_someone NOT_whom NOT_the NOT_teens NOT_presume NOT_was NOT_killed as a result of that collision . Fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess , they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again . A year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change . Relationships fizzle , future dreams crumble , and attitudes change . But , they can not NOT_forget NOT_what NOT_they NOT_did . And apparently , neither can someone else . Someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message : \" i know what you did last summer . \" The letter - writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens . It 's now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it 's too late . While this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it 's impact had to be generated with extreme close - ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best . There is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills . It could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders . It could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film . It could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you 're alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you do n't NOT_walk NOT_towards NOT_them NOT_yelling \" NOT_hello \" . Once you yell \" hello \" , you can expect an extreme close - up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse . It 's difficult to be in suspense when you know what 's about to happen . The only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i 'm not NOT_sure NOT_if NOT_the NOT_local NOT_costume NOT_store NOT_sells NOT_rubber NOT_slickers and hooks . The horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it .", "I REALLY , REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD", "These guys are not NOT_artists .

Some of them are n't even good . Some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful \" un indien dans la ville \" ( presented as \" little indian , big city , \" and remade into that crap tim allen flick , \" jungle2jungle \" ) , and this . What could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick . \" french twist \" ( the \" cool \" american title , not NOT_the NOT_real NOT_one , which was \" gazon maudit , \" literally meaning \" twisted ground , \" or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them . Loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not NOT_exactly NOT_happily NOT_married . Always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out . And one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co - writer / director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off . So she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo . But she soons starts to not NOT_only NOT_fall NOT_in NOT_love NOT_with NOT_marijo , but she 's also realizes she 's still in love with alain chabat . So , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both . She 'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she 'll rest by herself . After all , she needs it if she 's gon na have more sex than sylvia kristel . The film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there 's the little ironic ( ! ! ! ) Ending .

What 's shocking is this was not NOT_only NOT_one NOT_of NOT_france NOT_'s NOT_biggest NOT_hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) . The writing and directing is really the big problem with it . Josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy is n't NOT_very NOT_humerous , NOT_entertaining , NOT_or even deep at all . Even woody allen 's not - NOT_very - NOT_good \" NOT_a NOT_midsummer NOT_night NOT_'s NOT_sex NOT_comedy \" NOT_is NOT_intelligent , NOT_well - NOT_written , and possesses some depth . This is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch . The film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn - near painful to watch . Thank god for the fast forward button . The acting , however , is n't NOT_bad NOT_at NOT_all . The actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she 's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) . And alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband . But \" french twist \" is just pretty lame . It 's not NOT_overly NOT_horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments . But it 's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill - advised distribution of a foreign film ."]
